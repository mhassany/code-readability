At my day job, a (bad) decision was made long ago to run everything under a single global shared venv...  we are in the middle of a multi-year migration to fix that, but in the meantime it'd be nice to not have our hands tied on an old flask version just because we can't upgrade a few of the dependencies.\r\n\r\nThat said, it feels dangerous to fully remove versions... I would still leave minimum requirements in `setup.py` to prevent installing versions that are _already_ known to break.\r\n\r\nWhat about adding something to the docs like:\r\n> We only develop/test with the latest stable versions of our dependencies. You may be able to use older versions, but we don't guarantee it. If you find a version incompatibility, please file an issue on our GitHub repo so that we can bump the minimum required version for that dependency.\r\n\r\nAnd then also bump the dependencies to latest in `tox.ini`?\r\n\r\n"

This makes it difficult for projects like yours to update, especially if there's no actual reason that a newer version is needed.\r\n\r\nIf I remove version information completely, `pip install -U flask` would update all the dependencies too, without forcing everything, but would make no guarantees about older supported versions.

When people using Flask, should we expect that they are also using Werkzeug, Jinja2, itsdangerous and click directly? I don't think so. Even if they are using them directly, it won't break things too much/often.\r\n\r\nThe situation of @jeffwidman is really bad. But it has nothing to do with Flask's versions. That global environment will fail sooner or later if they are going to upgrade something.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that we keep a newer version of the dependencies, but not necessary to be the latest.
