Is this \"more than 5 views\" large, or 300K+ lines large?\n\n2) What sort of trouble can you get into with thread-local objects? That's not clear to me; examples would help a lot.\n\nRegardless of how these are addressed, I think the sentiment is correct that the intro is not the best place to warn people about all potential pitfalls.\n"
