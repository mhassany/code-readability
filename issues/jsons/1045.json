If there is then I have no idea what is happening, if there isn't then that is the confirmation that your registry is borked - I've got no real suggestions of what to do to fix it (save for manually adding each one you need again). If you have another windows machine then I guess you could export the `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT` and then import it into the broken one although make sure you backup the registry first.\n"
