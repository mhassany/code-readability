    "body": "# There should be two `__init__.py` files in the layout example, one under the folder \"blueprints\" and the other one under folder \"admin\".\n\nlike this:\n\n```\nyourpackage/\n    blueprints/\n        admin/\n            templates/\n                admin/\n                    index.html\n                __init__.py\n            __init__.py\n```\n\nHowever, I think this might confuse people about which folder each `__init__.py` is in.\n\nSo, I think put the slash at front can make the example easier to understand.\n"
