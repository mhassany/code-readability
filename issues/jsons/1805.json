    "body": "For this example I use ZeroMQ but I suppose any socket library could do. This is the code\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport zmq\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\ncontext = zmq.Context()\nsocket = context.socket(zmq.REP)\nsocket.bind('tcp://*:5500')\n\napp.debug = True  # Commenting this line does the trick\napp.run()\n```\n\nAs when using DEBUG process is fork()ed, the code tries to bind twice. Obviously, Flask knows how to open the port only once, so I'm wondering how to do the same for functions that bind()?\n",
