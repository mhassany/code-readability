    "body": "It looks like deep down, Flask calls `SocketServer.py` (a source code file for Python) to make its server.  But `SocketServer.py` has a call to `os.fork()`, which isn't supported at all on Windows. It would be great to use something besides `SocketServer`, or maybe a modified version of `SocketServer`.  When you make a HTTP request, it first calls `SocketServer.process_request`, which then calls `os.fork`.\n\nMore importantly (to me at least), does anyone have a workaround?\n",
