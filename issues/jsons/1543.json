    "body": "In the docs the section [The Status of Python 3](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/docs/advanced_foreword.rst) states that you _strongly recommend using Python 2.6 and 2.7_.\n\nWell, isn't it about time to officially recommend to use Python 3 instead? Has this been discussed before (recently)?\n\nI myself at least never ran in any problems using Python 3 with Flask. Though, admittedly, I don't have any large projects or unusual dependencies - or maybe I just instinctively avoid anything that's not Python 3 compatible and thus never noticed problems.\n\nStill, it seems to me that a recommendation to Python 3 is reasonable, unless you have special dependencies, and it doesn't look to me that there are many (active) Flask-\\* packages that require Python 2.\n",
