    "body": "Using a regular `CliRunner` requires passing a `ScriptInfo` instance that knows how to load the app being tested, otherwise `app.cli` commands will fail. This adds `app.test_cli_runner`, which creates an instance of `app.test_cli_runner_class`, which defaults to `FlaskCliRunner`.\r\n\r\nThis runner's `invoke` method adds `obj=ScriptInfo(create_app=lambda: app)` so that invoking commands works as expected. It also sets the command to `app.cli` by default, so `invoke(args=['my-command', ...])` can invoke commands by name to test that they were actually registered."
