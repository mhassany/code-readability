Rationale: Many people use a special gunicorn-or-whatever runner in\nproduction, but start a quick local \"manage.py runscript\" when they want to\ntest something / reproduce a bug. In this case it's helpful to not require\na different set of options that the user has to remember, or to have to use\na second config file which could go out of date.\n",
