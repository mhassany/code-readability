    "body": "### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI have mounted multiple blueprints for serving static files at the same base url, as I use this pattern when developing with other web frameworks (though I am unfamiliar with the limitations of python web programming). Perhaps this is the incorrect suggested mechanism for accomplishing this with Flask?\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.register_blueprint(Blueprint('mybp', __name__, static_folder='static', static_url_path=''), url_prefix='/a')\r\napp.register_blueprint(Blueprint('mybp1', __name__, static_folder='static_', static_url_path=''), url_prefix='/a')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe files in `static` where accessible and the ones in `static_` were not. The behavior was silent, there was no traceback. \r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: 2.7.12\r\n* Flask version: 0.12.2\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.14.1\r\n\r\nthanks so much, y'all! I'm just trying to figure out how to make an abstraction for my many folders to be accessible from a single route that serves static files.\r\n",
