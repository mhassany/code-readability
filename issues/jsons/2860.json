The resultant directory is then outside the context of the project, and the `os.chdir` causes any attempted imports of local code to fail.\r\n\r\nI would have submitted a PR removing that `os.chdir`, but I wasn't sure it would have been accepted. I assume its there to allow someone to run `flask` from inside a subfolder of their application, but the location of the `.env` file isn't necessarily indicative of that.",

I have a `.env` file in my home directory that I `source $HOME/.env` in my `.bashrc` so I can keep the latter unified across machines and checked into version control. My projects live in paths under my home directory.\r\n\r\nSeparately, I have a large work project that will start using `flask run` to launch a number of apps from subdirectories in a large monorepo, where there may be a `.env` file at the repo root. We'll need to account for this issue and either create setup.py files for `pip install -e .` or use `python -m flask run`.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be helpful if `flask run` displayed its working directory as part of startup, to help highlight when dotenv hauls it way outside your project path. Or display the CWD when this particular import error appears.\r\n\r\n> Install your application, as described in the tutorial, and you should no longer have to deal with pythonpath issues.\r\n\r\nIf I'd been following the official tutorial, I wouldn't have known to skip to the _end_ of the tutorial to find [this advice](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/install/):\r\n\r\n> Make the Project Installable\r\n> This is being introduced late in the tutorial, but in your future projects you should always start with this.\r\n"
