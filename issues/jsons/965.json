I'm using Windows 8, PyCharm, Python 2.7.4, and Flask 0.10.\n\nI followed the documentation to create the Flaskr application which is working great!  So then I moved on to the unit testing application and began following the instructions.\n\nI created a new module as instructed, copied and pasted the example code, and then ran python flaskr_tests.py and got the following:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"flaskr_tests.py\", line 2, in <module>\n        import flaskr\nImportError: No module named flaskr\n\nI did everything as described but yet get this error?  I went back and checked everything and still can't figure out what I'm missing?\n",

The 'import flaskr' probably needs to be 'import Flaskr'\nif its not a python module ( python modules consist of a folder with a **init**.py : ex 'derp/**init**.py' ; say there's a file main.py up one directory up from derp, in main.py you could call import derp and it'd import everything in the folder derp. ) Otherwise you just call import python_file_name_without_py_extension\nThe markup is ruining the init, two underscores before and after init. Not trying to assume that you didn't know this already, I'm just generally having no idea.\n"
