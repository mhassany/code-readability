The least invasive fix was to replace it with a space. Alternative fixes would be removal of the character causing errors or adapting the build process.\r\n\r\nSecond issue was the missing `\\ifsphinxpdfoutput` macro. In this case it was only used to check if the output is PDF, which is now handled with an appropriate if statement.\r\n\r\nRelevant issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2514\r\nhttps://github.com/pallets/flask-docs/issues/3",

Change the LaTeX processor from pdfLaTeX to XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX, both understand Unicode in text and at least XeLaTeX allows to use any OpenType fonts.\r\n\r\nMethod B:\r\n1. Have a LaTeX font containing emoji (!= OpenType / TrueType)\r\n2. Have a mapping file containing all mappings (something like `\\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{1F389}{\\emojiPartyPopper}`).
