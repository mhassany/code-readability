I see two options here:\r\n\r\n- Close this PR and leave it as-is - i.e. let flask replace the builtin Jinja filter as is the case right now, which works fine\r\n- Populate the `json.dumps_function` and `json.dumps_kwargs` policies of Jinja when setting up the Jinja environment in Flask.\r\n\r\nBut since `_dump_arg_defaults` depends on application state (e.g. the blueprint handling the current request) the second option is not really feasible without very nasty hacks, so I think we'll just keep the current implementation."
