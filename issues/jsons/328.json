I'm listing the extension now, which based on your commit log was ready for listing some time ago (for listing, I'm only looking for stable packaging and clear public APIs).  For an approved listing, Flask-Peewee does not yet meet guidelines 1, 3, and 10.\n\nFor 1, it has many modules inside flaskext, but should instead have everything inside the flask_peewee (preferred) or flaskext.peewee (legacy) namespace.  For the flask_peewee case, it would not need to be a namespace package.  The shortest fix is to rename flaskext as it stands now to flask_peewee.\n\nFor 3, Flask-Peewee needs to support application factories.  This should be just a matter of adding Database.init_app and having the Database `__init__` work without an app object.  Of course, init_app would need to be called before Database could do it's work.  See the extenstiondev doc, further up from the guidelines for details on init_app, and refer to Flask-SQLAlchemy if needed.\n\nFor 10, Python 2.5 breaks, starting with the `with` statement.  (need to import with_statement)\n\nhttp://flask.pocoo.org/docs/extensiondev/#approved-extensions\n\nPS - I was reviewing against a checkout of code from last night -- I see a lot of Flask-Peewee activity today.\n"

I find it a little odd that this is a requirement, it seems like if something in my extension depends on an application object then it shouldn't be possible to instantiate without it.  To make it _not_ depend on an application object is to subvert the intent/purpose of the object.  The implementation seems gross, too.  To avoid circular imports in my own projects, I structure them like I do in the example app that ships with flask_peewee.\n3. Added from future statements in relevant modules\n"
