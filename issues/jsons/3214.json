However, there are still plenty of other types that will produce that error, such as returning a `bool`, or a `User` object, or a list of rows from a database query.\r\n\r\n`Flask.make_response` should check whether an otherwise unhandled value is a `BaseResponse` subclass or a `callable` before treating it as such. Then it can raise a more helpful error.",
