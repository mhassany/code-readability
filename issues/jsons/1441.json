Pull requests are always between branches.\n\nThe easiest way (well, the most fool-proof way in this case) to get your branch to a proper state is probably this:\n\n```\ngit fetch upstream\ngit reset --hard upstream/master\ngit cherry-pick f1dfe9a0c73baafb2bf9fa31c41e829bedd4b59a\ngit push -f\n```\n\nThis assumes `upstream` is the git remote pointing to the main Flask repo. If necessary, you can add it using this command:\n\n```\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask.git\n```\n\nYou also might want to clean the `master` branch in your repo. To do so, switch to master using `git checkout master` and then `git reset --hard upstream/master` - after that, force-push that branch, too.\n\n---\n\nA good advice for the future: Whenever you work on pull requests or feature branches, always use `git pull --rebase` to sync with upstream: `git pull --rebase upstream master`\n"
