    "body": "The `imp` module has been deprected in 3.4 and seem to be used in 2 places : `flask/config.py`  and `scripts/flaskext_compat.py` to create modules. \n\nIt should be easy to replace with `types.ModuleType(name)` I guess. \n\ndiscovered because I'm running with `-W error`  on another project, which change the warning in errors, and I fail here even before reaching the other lib where I'm trying to find where the warning are coming from. \n\nI'll try to see if i can send  PR to fix that, \n\nThanks\n"
