    "body": "Hi,  I'm reading the docs and working on code at the same time with somewhat narrow windows.  \r\nThe Flask docs have a big sidebar on the left that is not always useful, and worse the body text has a fixed width that pushes it off the right side of the page.  Makes it very hard to read without constantly scrolling.\r\n\r\nDoesn't fit in with old-school html wrapping or new responsive hotness.  Disabling:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiv.document {\r\n\t/* width: 940px; */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the dev tools fixed the width problem, responsive css could disable the sidebar when the window is narrow.  Cheers,\r\n",
