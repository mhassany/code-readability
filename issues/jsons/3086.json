    "body": "Hey guys,\r\nI am trying to achieve a automatic redirect to the '/' node on either timeout or if a variable is set to a specific value. And this should work from all pages. So it doesnt matter on which site the user is, the automatic logout will trigger.\r\n\r\nI thought something like \r\nwhile redirect = False:\r\n      do routing and stuff\r\n      at some point redirect = True\r\nredirect(url_for('index'))\r\n\r\nAny ideas? If the while thing is posible, how can I wrap the whole application? There has to be a better solution\r\n",
