    "body": "I would love to see this project updated, but it seems to have been abandoned by its creator. Still doesn't support Python 3 and hasn't given any love to PyPI for almost 4 years. It seems impossible to get in contact with the creator. This PR removes the reference of `Flask-Uploads` from the docs. Another option would be to have a NOTE about it being abandoned. I think it also makes sense to remove it from the [Flask extensions list](http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/) (where's the repo for that?)\n\n[Here's a 2 year old ticket on Bitbucket that fixes Python 3 support](https://bitbucket.org/leafstorm/flask-uploads/pull-request/5/modernizing/diff). No reply what-so-ever from @leafstorm. His last public activity on Bitbucket was three years ago.\n\nI'll e-mail him with a reference to this ticket to see if we can get a reply. Perhaps with this ticket we can get the project owner's attention.\n\nThe best alternative would of course be to get development going on the project again, perhaps by adding more contributors to the project. Let me know how you feel about all of this. :blush:\n",

I'll also sign off on a PR to the Flask Web site changing the Flask-Uploads entry to have your name as the maintainer - the file you'll need to change is https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-website/blob/master/flask_website/listings/extensions.py.\n\nBesides the PyPI admin rights and recognition as maintainer by @mitsuhiko, I don't think there's anything else I have that you would need in order to get set up. But let me know if anything I have control over is blocking you from taking over.\n\nAnd if anyone's interested in maintaining Flask-CouchDB, Flask-Login, Flask-Themes, or Flask-XML-RPC, the same offer applies.\n"

Once that's done, I'll migrate it over to Github, and then add a few niceties like Travis, fix python 3 compatibility, etc.\n\n@leafstorm can you give me admin access on the bitbucket repo? My bitbucket username is 'jeffwidman': https://bitbucket.com/leafstorm/flask-uploads/admin/access\n\nOnce I migrate to Github I will update the BB repo with links to the Github repo, similar to [the way pytest handled their migration](https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/pytest/).\n"

Someone tried it on Python 3 and confirmed [it's working perfectly](stackoverflow.com/questions/33840765/flask-uploads-gives-attributeerror). \n\nI've also swapped from using Flask modules (which Flask deprecated quite a while ago) to operating as a normal Flask extension using blueprints. @mattupstate did a lot of the heavy lifting there in a [pull request back in 2013](https://bitbucket.org/leafstorm/flask-uploads/pull-requests/5/modernizing) that just hadn't been merged in, and I tidied up a few last bits.\n\nAt this point, I think everything is ready for a new release to be cut, I'm just waiting on commit rights to Pypi. \n\nFor now, you can install directly from github using Pip: \n\n```\npip install git+https://git@github.com/jeffwidman/flask-uploads.git\n```\n"

I was a bit surprised, as I had no idea anyone other than you were a collaborator until you gave me access to the BB repo. Ron said he was too busy, which is understandable. \n\nMax replied this morning basically saying thanks for the hard work but he had commit rights on PyPI and he isn't willing to transfer them. Instead since there was so much interest he was planning to migrate the project to his own github repo and suggested I contribute the fixes there.\n\nHe said he wished I'd tried to contact him sooner, which made no sense because multiple people have left comments on that bitbucket repo over the past few years asking if it was abandoned, with no reply. There was also that beautiful pull request from @mattupstate modernizing things that sat ignored. That's why we're even discussing this issue in the first place.\n\nI don't mind contributing to other people's projects, and I'm not trying to stir up drama here, but it does leave a bad taste in my mouth that I spent the better portion of a day fixing stuff up only to have a collaborator who's been absent from the project for years decide he's going to take control by strong arming PyPI rights. \n\nI'd be curious to hear Max expound on his thinking more here, maybe I'm just misunderstanding something. \n"

I appreciate you being willing to let others continue with the project. \n\nI'm still confused why someone who isn't the project repo owner, [never made any commits to the project](https://bitbucket.org/leafstorm/flask-uploads/commits/all), or commented on any issues decides he's unwilling to transfer Pypi rights to the project, despite completely ignoring the project for years. \n\nWhat am I missing here?\n"

When I said yes, he apparently decided that was not the answer he was looking for (I guess he was hoping I would say no and give the project to him) and decided to go on a holy mission to make the project his. I have to say, we as a community should not tolerate this kind of nonsense.\n\nShall we all just engage in a coup d'\u00e9\u00b7tat every time a project maintainer doesn't hand us the reigns? Surely not.\n\nI don't have the time or interest to participate in this kind of puerile bullshit. Jeff, grow up man, I don't know what your problem is, but you have no right to misrepresent the situation and lie about what actually happened--I responded to your inquiries, I answered your questions, you decided you could go over my head and get permission from Matthew when I didn't give you the answers you wanted to hear.\n\nIf the community wants to see updates to the project, I've already cleaned it up quite a bit and published a new release some weeks ago--this includes unreleased work from the BitBucket repo. I'm happy to continue to do so. However, I'm not happy to reward Jeff's behavior by handing it over to him--I don't think that sets a good precedent for the community.\n\nFinally, I'm busy, this kind of nonsense is distracting and a massive waste of everyone's time. I'd appreciate it if I not be contacted again about this--please don't mention me in this thread. Thanks for your understanding! :smile:\n"
