Provide\r\nany extra information that may be useful / related to your problem.\r\nIdeally, create an [MCVE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve), which helps us\r\nunderstand the problem and helps check that it is not caused by something in\r\nyour code. -->\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe test client should be able to set cookies in a manner that the application object can read them. There's a `.set_cookie(...)` method but it doesn't seem to work -- after stepping through it I think the issue is that cookies aren't getting signed?\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport flask\r\n\r\napp = flask.Flask(\"test\")\r\n\r\n\r\n@app.route(\"/\")\r\ndef index():\r\n    assert \"thing\" in app.session\r\n    return \"okay\"\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test():\r\n    with app.test_client() as client:\r\n        client.set_cookie(\"example.com\", \"thing\", \"value\")\r\n        response = client.get(\"/\", base_url=\"http://example.com\")\r\n    assert response.status_code == 200\r\n\r\ntest()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe assertion is tripped due to an empty session, despite `set_cookie()` seemingly succeeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: 3.6.7\r\n* Flask version: 1.1.1\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.15.4\r\n",
