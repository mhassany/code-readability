            "body": "My idea is related to #33. There are two additional attributes on the request object: `request.module_args` and `request.app_args` (or maybe store them on `g` or something, I don't know). You can use before_request filters to move the proper arguments from `view_args` to those two.\n\nThen, whenever you generate a URL, it goes through all the arguments in `module_args` (if the target endpoint is in the same module) and `app_args`. If an argument is in one of those and not in the arguments passed to `url_for` and the endpoint is expecting said argument, it automatically gets passed in. There could also probably be an app-wide URL prefix. (i.e. `/<language>`)\n\nTo make use of this for such a URL prefix:\n1. Create a `before_request` function that pops `language` from `request.view_args` and adds it to `request.module_args`, and probably also put it in `g.language` or something.\n2. Write your request handlers to _not_ take a `language` argument.\n3. Whenever you call `url_for('something')`, if `language` is not in the kwargs, it will automatically add `request.app_args['language']`. If it is in the kwargs, on the other hand, it will do nothing. (That way you can have a link like \"Ver en espa\u00f1ol\" that links to `url_for(request.endpoint, language='es', **request.view_args)`.)\n\nAnd something like that for modules, but `module_args` is processed before `app_args` and is only applied if the target endpoint is in the same module as the source endpoint. There's probably a way to make this a bit smoother, but this is just to get the metaphorical ball rolling.\n"
