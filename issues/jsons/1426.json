    "body": "Hi,\n\nI was trying to create a small sample for another issue and run into a problem. I have a very simple demo app. This is the main file:\n\n``` python\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    from sign import sign as sign_blueprint\n    app.register_blueprint(sign_blueprint, url_prefix='/sign')\n    app.run()\n```\n\nBlueprint `sign` lives inside the `sign` directory and the `__init__.py` file there declares it.\n\n``` python\nfrom flask import Blueprint\nsign = Blueprint('sign', __name__)\nfrom . import views\n```\n\n`views` just contains a simple handler that returns the string ok when requested. The problem is that my request was completely ignored. I started debugging and the routes collection has only the `static` route. The details for my blueprint disappeared.\n\n![Structure](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/627517/7091648/a4491eb6-df81-11e4-9f54-03cf586848c4.png)\n\nWriting \n- http://127.0.0.1:5000/sign/order/2345\n- http://127.0.0.1:5000/sign/order/\n- http://127.0.0.1:5000/sign/\n- http://127.0.0.1:5000/sign\n\ngets the same 404 error. It seems that somehow my blueprint is ignored and no route is created.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThank you,\n\nFederico\n",

I understand that importing views (`from . import views`) will subscribe the routes under that package using the `route` decorator and thought I had found an unexpected behaviour. In any case, thanks to your comment I rechecked the views registered and realised that I was using the main app route instead of the blueprint's.\n\nThank you,\n\nFederico\n"
