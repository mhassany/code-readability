At this point of writing the `README` seems a bit insufficient for a project of the size of flask. Also I will suggest to change the format to `.rst`, this way it will be compliant the requirements for `sdist`'s and also offer more readability on github.\n\nI would be glad to start a new issue and come up with a draft to an improvement, what do you guys think about this idea?\n"

For Werkzeug, we still made it a rst file, but nevertheless i don't think any additional content would be accepted.\n"
