Is any specific configuration required besides installing watchdog?\n\nI run with:\n\n``` python\nrun_simple(\n        hostname='0.0.0.0',\n        port=5000,\n        application=app,\n        use_reloader=True,\n        use_debugger=True,\n        reloader_type='watchdog'\n    )\n\n# * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n# * Restarting with inotify reloader\n```\n\nI'm under vagrant and tried both with and without NFS to no success.\n",

            "body": "Ok, I did some research and can say that reload is actually happening. The thing is that watchdog-reload won't work under vagrant, virtualbox, and probably docker as well. This is not the reloader's fault, just how the underlying inotify works.\n\nFor reload to work under guest os you need to use stat reloader. It actually takes about 90 seconds to do a single reload with stat reloader consuming 123% of CPU. That is for us and our project. The exact response time and CPU will depend on the number of files in your project.\n\nThere is this pull request mitsuhiko/werkzeug#669 that will allow you to regulate what files are being watched. Not yet on PyPi though.\n\nRight now we are rolling or own reload solution will werkzeug master and [poke](https://github.com/projectshift/poke).\n"
