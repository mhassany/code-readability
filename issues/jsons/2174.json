    "body": "Not a bug report, per se, but still should be noted. On the [Security Considerations page](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/security/), after describing the XSS remediation that Jinja2 provides, it describes the one caveat that unquoted html attributes are still vulnerable. It follows with a \"correct\" example:\r\n`<a href=\"{{ href }}\">the text</a>`\r\n\r\nHowever that example is also vulnerable to XSS. An attacker could still set `href` to `javascript:alert(1)` to inject javascript into the tag (although it would require a user to click the link).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the example should use a different quoted attribute as the example, like a default value for an input field or something of the like.",
