Only dev version has , which not work for 0.12.\r\n\r\nI want to change the logging format , after  I add below code \r\n```\r\n    steam_formatter = logging.Formatter(\"[STREAM][%(levelname)s][%(asctime)s][%(name)s][Line:%(lineno)d] %(message)s\")\r\n    stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\r\n    stream_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\r\n    stream_handler.setFormatter(steam_formatter)\r\n    app.logger.addHandler(stream_handler)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI find flask would print two log message with different format .  Soon I understand flask still keep its original stream handler . I think reset logging format should be clarified in stable docs.",
