This is deprecated since 0.11.x right? The development version has that paragraph removed, so I just did the same for this branch.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nCommit checklist:\r\n\r\n* add tests that fail without the patch\r\n* ensure all tests pass with ``pytest``\r\n* add documentation to the relevant docstrings or pages\r\n* add ``versionadded`` or ``versionchanged`` directives to relevant docstrings\r\n* add a changelog entry if this patch changes code\r\n\r\nTests, coverage, and docs will be run automatically when you submit the pull\r\nrequest, but running them yourself can save time.\r\n-->\r\n",
