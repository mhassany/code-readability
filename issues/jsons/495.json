Reviewing this further, I'd like to confirm on the Flask team that the padded API for the jsonify function is what we want.  In the current implementation, padded can be a boolean or a string, and that string points to the URL query argument which supplies the function name.\n\nThis is a feature added in 0.9-dev, and is not yet fully released.  I added a test to make sure we fix this issue before release.  If we change the jsonify padded behavior, I'll send an announcement to the mailing list.\n"
