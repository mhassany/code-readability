            "body": "Good call @TomIsPrettyCoool.\nSo this is a bug in the reloader - note that windows finds `flask` when prompted to, although it's `flask.exe`. the werkzeug reloader probably calls `flask` instead of `flask.exe`.\nI imagine there are two ways to solve this: (1) fix the reloader to use `flask.exe` on windows; (2) add batch file called `flask` next to `flask.exe` during flask install. (2) is probably easier and contained in flask, but (1) might solve future bugs for other packages.\n"
