I think all these little files are about as ugly as global state can be.\n- As with Werkzeug, we depend on a development version of tox, because the new version has a much more expressive config format to specify env-dependent requirements.\n- Greenlet is now installed in Travis and the tests are running\n- The memory leak test is still failing, i think we should add more information why we (who?) chose to skip this. I myself have no idea why.\n- I removed `python setup.py audit` as i am not sure anybody uses that. Instead i'd suggest to use pyflakes directly, or better IMO, flake8.\n"

Then I can run:\n\n```\n$ py.test tests\n```\n\n> avoid \u201c**init**.py\u201d files in your test directories. This way your tests can run easily against an installed version of mypkg, independently from the installed package if it contains the tests or not.\n\nThe `tests` folder shouldn't be treated as a package. `py.test` will run the tests in the context of the `tests` folder, making the `tests` the current working directory. \n"
