    "body": "I was trying to get deployment with fabric and distribute done like explained in the docs. However the deployment script always aborted with this error message\n\n```\nwarning: manifest_maker: standard file 'setup.py' not found\n```\n\nSo I tried for hours to find the problem and it seems that I have found it (although it is possible that the documented script works fine on other installations - I can only talk about my).\n\nThis is how the source code looks in the deploy function right now:\n\n```\n#...\nwith cd('/tmp/yourapplication'):\n    run('tar xzf /tmp/yourapplication.tar.gz')\n# now setup the package with our virtual environment's\n# python interpreter\nrun('/var/www/yourapplication/env/bin/python setup.py install')\n#...\n```\n\nI had to change it like this to make the script work:\n\n```\n#...\nwith cd('/tmp/yourapplication'):\n    run('tar xzf /tmp/yourapplication.tar.gz')\n# You have to be inside the folder where 'setup.py' resides\n# in order to make it work\nwith cd('/tmp/yourapplication/%s' % dist):\n    # now setup the package with our virtual environment's\n    # python interpreter\n    run('/var/www/yourapplication/env/bin/python setup.py install')\n#...\n```\n\nPlus I changed `run('mkdir /tmp/yourapplication')` to `run('mkdir -p /tmp/yourapplication')` because after a failed deployment the dir has not been removed and the next deployment attempt prematurely ended \"because the directory already existed\"\n",
