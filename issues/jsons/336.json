So you can do something like:\n\n```\n{% with errors = get_flashed_messages(category_filter=[\"error\"]) %}\n{% if errors %}\n<div class=\"alert-message block-message error\">\n  <a class=\"close\" href=\"#\">\u00d7</a>\n  <ul>\n  {%- for msg in errors %}\n  <li>{{ msg }}</li>\n  {% endfor -%}\n  </ul>\n</div>\n{% endif %}\n{% endwith %}\n```\n\n...\n\nCheers,\n  Steven\n",
