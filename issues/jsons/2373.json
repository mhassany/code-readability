    "body": "`app.jinja_env` is a property that creates the environment on first access. If `app.debug` is not configured explicitly before accessing `app.jinja_env`, `env.auto_reload` will be calculated as `False`. The `run` command's `debug` flag can change the app's debug flag, at which point `auto_reload` needs to be reconfigured.\r\n\r\nThis extracts the logic for `auto_reload` to `Flask.templates_auto_reload`. It adds a new method to be called by `app.run` or `ScriptInfo.load_app` that will reconfigure the app if `debug` is set by the command.\r\n\r\ncontinues #1910\r\ncloses #1907"
