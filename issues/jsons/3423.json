    "body": "If ever the `flask.session` is used, and there's an intermediary cache between the Flask app and the user (Squid, Cloudinary, whatever), there's a significant risk that a user could see a page that was built for another user, exposing sensitive information (e.g. see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13768007/browser-caching-issues-in-flask and https://github.com/mattupstate/flask-security/issues/334).\r\n\r\nThe solution to this is for the application developer to return a `cache-control: no-cache` or `cache-control: private` header with any pages that might contain sensitive information.\r\n\r\nHowever, many project developers will likely forget to do this. Would it make sense for Flask to explicitly return a `cache-control: private` header by default if the `flask.session` is not empty?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we're planning to implement something like this in our apps:\r\n\r\n``` python3\r\n@app.after_request\r\ndef make_sessions_private(response):\r\n    if flask.session:\r\n        response.cache_control.private = True\r\n        response.cache_control.public = False\r\n    return response\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?"
