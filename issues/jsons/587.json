            "body": "I'd also like to add that the port Werkzeug is now in a somewhat stable state.\n\nThe `urls` module of Werkzeug has to be rewritten and merged with some other code forked from the stdlib (`urlparse`), but i don't think the current implementation hinders the Flask port for now. There's some work left for Flask itself too. IIRC especially `flask.json` was mentioned by @mitsuhiko because of the difference in behavior of `json` in Py2, `json` in Py3, and `simplejson`.\n\nYou can help us by testing experimental versions of Flask and Werkzeug from the following branches:\n\nFlask's port: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/tree/sprint-branch\nWerkzeug's port: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/werkzeug/tree/sprint-branch\n\nThese should work for simple apps, but i'd love to know if they work for more complex ones too.\n"
