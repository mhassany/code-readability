    "body": "Currently, the `run()` method of the Flask object takes as parameters `the host, the port, the debug mode, and some options (like the reloader mode)`.\n\nIt would be cool to add a `server` parameter that will be set default to Werkzeug's `run_simple()` function but could be another one like Gunicorn.\n\nTo run an application with our choice server, we could do:\n`application.run(host=0.0.0.0, port=5000, server='gunicorn')`\n\nThis is mostly a \u00abshortcut\u00bb than a real feature. If you have any cons (or pros, why not), please tell me :)\n",
