    "body": "I'm in a project where double-quoted HTML attributes is part of the style guide. We're also using data- attributes to pass data to code and consider it a bad practice to render anything directly within scripts.\n\nBeing able to remove `|safe` within `<script>` seems convenient at first glance. But after discovering that it changes the behavior of `|tojson` everywhere else when using double-quoted attributes, it doesn't seem as nice. It's just less intuitive overall. Forcing you to use a particular HTML style or requiring `|forceescape` (as opposed to just `|e`) isn't really a great tradeoff for implying `|safe` within `<script>`.\n\nSo the underlying question. Can we allow `|tojson` to work within double-quotes attributes again? Or is there some technical reason why we can't. And if not, why not add another filter to use within `<script>` blocks instead so the principal of least surprise isn't violated?\n",

Particularly when mixing Flask with a front-end JS framework.\n\nThe problem is more about breaking [the principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment). Right now `tojson` works differently depending on what style quotation you use. Like Python, it shouldn't make any difference if your HTML style guide uses one or the other.\n\nIf shoving json in HTML attributes seems wildly awkward to the Flask community, why not favor consistency and make `tojson` break or complain in _both_ places? Require `|forceescape` in single quotes too. That way there's no surprises when going between projects that favor a different quotation style, or when refactoring `<div data-field='{{ field }}'>` to `<div data-field=\"{{ field }}\">` (or vice versa).\n"
