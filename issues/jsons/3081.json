It is good russian translation, but it is bit outdated. I want to renew it, and continue to maintain.\r\n\r\nBut then I encountered an issue (https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1023) about the Korean language, so I want to ask: \r\n\r\nOK, you can't check translation because you don't have any russian developers, so you can't make it as official translation.\r\nBut then, what I (and other translators) can do? Can you give a link to that translation, and say, that this is unofficial? Can I search for russian developers on some other sites and ask them to check translation? What if I translate docs commit-by-commit, so you will always see, is it new or outdated? So, if I want to translate it \"right-way\", how can I do it?\r\n",
