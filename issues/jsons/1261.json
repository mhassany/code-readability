Setting use_reloader=False works, but I miss the reloader. This works as expected when running on Python 2.7. I'm not sure if this is an issue on Flask, Werkzeug or Pycharm. Is there somebody with better insights on Werkzeug internals and  how the Pycharm debugger works that could help me with this?.\n",
