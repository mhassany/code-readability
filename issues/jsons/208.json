It's a little bit weird because of a bunch of different issues.\n- an application in non debug mode will not propagate exceptions. There should be a TESTING mode that raises exceptions through and also closes down the context unless preserved.\n- Extensions should not connect to databases and similar things in before_request but attach to the context as necessary by themselves.\n- Docs should outline how testing is supposed to happen.\n",
