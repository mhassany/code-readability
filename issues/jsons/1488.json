    "body": "We're using flask to serve mostly REST endpoints, and doing some setup at startup to create all the URL rules. Effectively, we're calling `app.add_url_rule()` for each method for each endpoint. This means that flask autogenerates an OPTIONS method and function for each ( https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/flask/app.py#L1019 ), with no way to override.\n\nCan `provide_automatic_options` be added as a kwarg to `add_url_rule`, in case nothing is specified on the `view_func`?\n"
