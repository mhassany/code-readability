What mime-types does Flask recognize, and what does it do when it encounters them?\r\n1. Reading `data` also reads `stream`, so if you call `data` and then `stream`, `stream` will be empty.\r\n1. Similarly, reading `stream` before `data` results in an empty `data`\r\n1. Sending a JSON payload in a GET request results in a populated `form` attribute (which, as per docs, only populates on POST and PUT)\r\n\r\nThese are very much not clear from the documentation, and led me to great frustration.\r\n\r\nNote 2: Although it's reasonable that `form` does not automagically take JSON payloads and interpret them as form data.... it might be nice to point that out explicitly, given how much use JSON has.\r\n\r\n",
