At least for me it's much easier to read longer documentation on a e-ink device rather than a monitor, and PDF are rendered quite awfully on my Kindle 3g.\n\nI see that there's a builder for Sphinx that permits to build epub files along with their HTML versions here: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/builders.html#module-sphinx.builders.epub\n\nePub would be a easier format to convert, through Calibre we could have a 1:1 conversion in MOBI format too.\n\nThank you\n",

I've just downloaded and converted it into MOBI format because unfortunately my Kindle cannot handle directly the ePub format, but I have always seen that Calibre can render a perfect copy of an ePub so I guess that if the MOBI file is OK then the original ePub will be OK too.\n\nHere are some random screenshots I've taken from my Kindle device:\n\nhttps://skitch.com/fmaida/g5wi9/screen-shot-26466\nhttps://skitch.com/fmaida/g5wsd/screen-shot-26467\nhttps://skitch.com/fmaida/g5wsp/screen-shot-26468\n\nFrom a quick check by reading the first pages with the internal ebook reader that is available within Calibre it seems that the ePub file is a perfect rendition of the HTML documentation; I tried some links and they were all working properly. I've uploaded the documentation into my Kindle and I'm bringing it with me so I'll read it a little bit while I'm going to work and coming back, and tonight I'll be able to tell you if there are any problems with the format.\n\nMeanwhile, thank you again because today you saved my eyes from reading 250+ pages on a monitor ;-)\n"
