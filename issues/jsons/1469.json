It would have been much easier to discover the cause if the following tip was given:\n\nProblem: application runs but can not access other files:\n\nFor WSGI applications, all paths used should always be absolute path names.  Even though the app will work fine using relative paths with the simpler python serving method, they will not work with WSGI.\n",
