The idea was that `send_file` would never accidentally send a `octet-stream` when the user simply assumed the mimetype to be in the database. I didn't think about `send_from_directory`, but I suppose you could just use `mimetype.add_type` to add the missing mimetype (probably should be documented).\n\nIs this the behavior you can agree with? In any case if you want to change your decision (you approved the mentioned PR), it needs a doc update in `upgrading.rst`, last paragraph here: https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/master/docs/upgrading.rst#changes-to-send_file\n"
