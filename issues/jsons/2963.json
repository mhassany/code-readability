    "body": "Flask currently supports importing app through a combination of module path and app variable name, such as '/usr/app.py:my_app'. When the module path contains a colon, it will conflict with this import way and a `flask.cli.NoAppException` will be raised.\r\n\r\nA file path on a Windows system may contain a colon followed by a slash. So we solved this problem on Windows by ignoring the colon followed by a slash when we split `app_import_path`. \r\n\r\nFix issue #2961.",
