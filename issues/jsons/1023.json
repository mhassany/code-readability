While I appreciate the effort and it's always great to see people excited to spend efforts on the project, especially on things that make it more approachable to new people, promoting this translation to something \"official\" implies that the documentation is developed with the same standards and by the same people as everything else.\n\nThis is however not the case. Afaik none of the people with commit access know korean, so we can't review it, we can't keep it up to date with the original etc. nor do we have any other regular contributors who do. This is however the standard I would like to see for an official translation and I think others probably have the same expectation or it would at least be reasonable for them to have it.\n"
