This kind of use could be made easier.\n### Proposal\n\nInstead of writing:\n\n```\nclass MyFantasticView(View):\n    ...\napp.add_url_rule('/fantastic/', view_func=MyFantasticView.as_view('fantastic'))\n```\n\nwe could make it easier and consistent with other parts of the API:\n\n```\n@app.route('/fantastic/', endpoint='fantastic')\nclass MyFantasticView(View):\n    ...\n```\n",
