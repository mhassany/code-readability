    "body": "The Flask development is vulnerable to RSnake's SlowLoris single-machine denial of service attack. I tested Flask on Ubuntu 14.04 with a Raspberry Pi Model B running Raspbian as the attacker. The DoS succeeded in under a second. This is generally caused by restrictive threading limits, see http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/\n\nUnfortunately, unlike many webservers, Flask does not seem to recover gracefully when the attack ends, instead throwing broken pipe errors and no longer serving pages until restarted. This affects both debug and normal modes.\n\nEdit: Looks like this was discovered previously and is mentioned here: http://librelist.com/browser//flask/2014/9/2/fwd-dos-via-socketserver/\n",
