It's not the most efficient way to do things, but if you were really concerned with performance you wouldn't be running a Python web application on a Windows Server to begin with :)\n"

            "body": "In reading back over my last comment, I apologize if I seemed rude - I certainly didn't intend to be.\n\nI assume you're operating in a corporate environment where you don't get to choose your OS, and may even have limited ability to install and configure software. If so, my condolences. I've been there, and it's not fun.\n\nI did a little more thinking and reading on the topic, and if you're able to reverse proxy you have some other options. When I was facing this, gevent and gunicorn both had scaling issues with Windows. Since then, at least gevent has moved to using libevent with their 1.0 version, and that seems to have resolved the issues.\n\nThat being the case, my first plan would be to tell IIS to reverse proxy from port 80 to port 8080, then run gevent attached to port 8080. gevent is available as a PyPI package, so many IT departments won't consider it \"installing\" software in the same way they'd see installing Apache as such. \n\nYour layout would be something like:\n\n![serving flask over iis](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/131414/560965/6738701e-c483-11e2-8d5e-8210165904eb.png)\n\nThis fixes a few problems for you. First, you don't have to install ISAPI-WSGI, because IIS isn't integrating a Python runtime at all. Second, I believe it would bypass the manifest issue I spoke about above, since the IIS application context and the context of the gevent script aren't tied to one another. Finally, this would enable you to easily move your configuration to a Linux machine in the future - or even a platform solution, like Heroku.\n\nPossible challenges - since your application is running outside of IIS, you'll need some sort of process management. [This SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32404/can-i-run-a-python-script-as-a-service-in-windows-how) shows you how to install a script as a Windows service, which is one option. Unless you solve this problem, you'd have to log in to the server and start gevent in a command prompt for the application to be online. That's exactly what I'd do for testing your config, but you need something that will start it when the computer boots and restarts it if it crashes. This is often done with `supervisord` on Linux.\n\nFinally, [here's someone on the Flask mailing list](http://librelist.com/browser//flask/2010/9/29/deploying-on-windows/#64165f0822668c0678ce2e8226389303) that's done the same thing a couple of years ago, and it appears that they ended up setting up gevent as a service.\n\nI wish you luck, and let me know if there's anything I can do to help. My email address is in my Github profile, feel free to contact me if you need to.\n"
