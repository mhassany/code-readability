Flask is a micro framework, but does provide conveniences out of the box which slow it down.  For example, it is consistently slower than the Werkzeug library on which it is built.  Without knowing the other frameworks, I would guess they provide even less out of the box, but once you start implementing routing, templating, etc. everything would even out.\n"
