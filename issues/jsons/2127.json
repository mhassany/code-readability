I have no experience with uwsgi, however I can't imagine that configuration with uwsgi changes.\r\n\r\nThe app factory pattern also still works. You would create a separate module that calls your factory at import time. We're looking at improving this experience.\r\n\r\nIn the future please ask those questions in the IRC channel or on stackoverflow. This is a bugtracker. Let's focus on the bug you reported."
