About the server, I had the same opinion as @untitaker, I thought it was something that should be tested in `Werkzeug` itself. The run application -> communicate with the server, etc, in my opinion they are integration tests. I just wanted to write some very simple tests to get started somehow and took the chance that `run` method wasn't being tested yet. Thanks for the feedback guys and I could you please tell me how to follow from here? It is worth making the changes @untitaker mentioned or these tests aren't necessary at all?\n"
