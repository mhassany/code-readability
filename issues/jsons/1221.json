I _think_ the intent of the original author is that classes should be designed/architected in a way that encourages reusing them throughout an application, and even across multiple application instances.\n\nWhat about reworking it into:\n\n> When designing your classes, it's important to make them easily reusable \n> at the module level. This means the object itself must not under any\n> circumstances store any application specific state and must be shareable\n> between different applications. \n\nOpen to alternative suggestions... \n"
