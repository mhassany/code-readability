    "body": "When SERVER_NAME in conf is not None and different to \"localhost\",  app.test_request_context() will be failure.\n\nInstead, we can do like this\n\n```\n  environ_overrides=dict(HTTP_HOST=app.conf['SERVER_NAME'],\n                        SERVER_NAME=app.conf['SERVER_NAME'])\n\n  app.text_request_context(environ_overrides=environ_overrides)\n```\n\nThat's OK. Just look at above there is no issue in test_request_context, but what can extensions which use test_request_context do ? It is not a good idea if it handled by themselves.\n\nFor example, in Flask-Script's shell command, it will make a text_request_context and run shell in this context. If Flask-Script don't deal with SERVER_NAME environ, shell command will fail. \n\nI believe that Flask should do something for that because SERVER_NAME is imported by Flask and using in create_url_adapter method and others.\n",
