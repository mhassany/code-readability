    "body": "I have been annoyed for a while by Flask's lazy loading feature, without even knowing about the feature or why it was annoying me. (The specific problem: when I have a bug in my app factory that should cause an immediate crash on startup, Flask swallowed the exception and only showed it to me with the first request.)\r\n\r\nSo this morning, I dug into the code and learned that this is not a bug, but clearly a deliberate feature added back in 2014 ago. I also learned about the workaround for this feature: `flask run --eager-loading`. Perfect! Nothing to fix here, right?\r\n\r\nSo what's the problem? Documentation! I had to dig into the source code to understand what was going on, and to figure out how make Flask behave the way I want. That should be described in the manual.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIn my perfect world, a bug in the app factory would cause an immediate crash on startup. But since delaying such crashes was clearly added deliberately to Flask, and has been there for 5 years, I do NOT propose changing this behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhat should happen: the next person who is annoyed or confused by this behaviour should find an explanation and a workaround in the docs.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport flask\r\n\r\napp = flask.Flask(__nam__)                     # <<< TYPO!!!\r\n\r\n@app.route('/')\r\ndef index():\r\n    return flask.make_response({\"foo\": 42}, 200)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nI google'ed, I searched the manual, and I could not figure out why Flask was making it hard to see my bugs. I had to read the source code to find out about `--eager-loading`.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: 3.6, 3.7\r\n* Flask version: 1.1.1\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.16.0\r\n",
