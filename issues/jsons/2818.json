    "body": "**This issue tracker is a tool to address bugs in Flask itself.\r\nPlease use the #pocoo IRC channel on freenode or Stack Overflow for general\r\nquestions about using Flask or issues not related to Flask.**\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to report a bug in Flask, fill out the template below. Provide\r\nany any extra information that may be useful / related to your problem.\r\nIdeally, create an [MCVE](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve), which helps us\r\nunderstand the problem and helps check that it is not caused by something in\r\nyour code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nTemplate should be renderd\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntaSession=Transaktionshandler(path,username,sha1pw[0][0])\r\n...some basic session stuff....\r\nreturn render_template(index.html)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nI am importing a Module that wraps my c++ code (python capi). That Modul contains a struct. When I create the struct some connections and threads are initialized. Nothing fails. After this i am doing some Session handling, nothing failes. But at the moment i want to render a template python crashes. When i return instate of render template somthing like  return \"TEST\", python do not crash.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when I don't load my Modul there is no problem.\r\n\r\nI am Debugging with msvc and i can see that the render_template function runs, but i cant't jump into the _render function of the templatin.py file.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: 3.5.4\r\n* Flask version: 1.0.2\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.14.1\r\n",
