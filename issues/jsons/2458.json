    "body": "The behavior of the float converter not matching decimal-less values is a poor choice in my opinion.  The problem is that Javascript lacks separate number types, and it will happily produce decimal-less number values from operations on several floating point values (e.g. 0.5 + 0.5).  As a result, some combinations of user input cause a route with a float converter to fail to resolve.\r\n\r\nI think better behavior would be for the float converter to match decimal-less values, but at a lower priority than the integer converter.  This would avoid the problem edge case route failures while still letting people define overlapping routes if they really wanted to.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: 3.6.1\r\n* Flask version: 0.12.2\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.12.2\r\n",
