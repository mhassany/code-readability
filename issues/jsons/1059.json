    "body": "Hi,\n I was searching for examples for flask-uploads to see if it is useful at all and discovered there needs to be:\n1. disambiguation between examples per version as the flask-uploads API has changed significantly between versions.\n2. disambiguation in examples between what is flask and what is the database\n3. a database free or at least a database isolated example:\n    - I downloaded sqlacademy only to discover the flask-uploads part of the example was out of date, I am now trying how to modify the couchDB example w/o having to install couchDB.\nI know you all aren't responsible for other's examples, but if you could provide your own working example, that would help greatly. Basically you are hurting your cause by making flask extensions difficult to use.\n\nThanks!\n",
