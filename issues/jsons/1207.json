Please excuse me if this assumption is incorrect.\n\nAt **http://flask.pocoo.org/**, which Google took me to, **clicking either of the latter links in 'Read the documentation or download as [PDF](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/flask-docs.pdf) and [zipped HTML](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/flask-docs.zip)'** took me to http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/flask-docs.pdf and http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/flask-docs.zip, respectively. **Both 404ed.**\n",
