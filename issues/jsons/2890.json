The latest stable version is Version 1.0.2..\r\n\r\nThe other builds (1.0.2 and master) fail: https://readthedocs.org/projects/flask/builds/.\r\n\r\nI suppose the config was change in RTD to look for that `requirements.txt` file that only appears in rtd branch.\r\n\r\nAs a user, I don't mind the warning, but I'm building a documentation for a lib using Flask with this intersphinx mapping:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nintersphinx_mapping = {\r\n    'flask': ('http://flask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/', None),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n I get an error due to the failed build as `http://flask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/objects.inv` is not fetchable.\r\n\r\nShould I use `https://flask.readthedocs.io/en/rtd/objects.inv` or is this temporary?\r\n\r\nThanks.",
