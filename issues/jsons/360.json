It is not compatible with Python 2.5 or 2.6 - the test suite uses several UnitTest functions added in 2.7 (assertIn, assertIsNotNone), and the extension itself uses str.format in several places.\n3. The setup.py docstring doesn't contain the URL of the documentation.\n\nThese are all small fixes, so I made them and submitted a pull request.\n"
