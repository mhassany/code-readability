    "body": "Hi,\n\nthe old regular expression in the lighttpd deployment documentation would also apply to any paths that start with '/static', but _are_ not actually the static/ directory - for example, /staticfoo would also be matched and passed through. As this can produce some nasty and hard-to-find bugs (when a route starts with 'static'), I've fixed the regex. It now matches /static, /static/, and everything below it. /staticfoo is no longer matched.\n- Sven\n",
