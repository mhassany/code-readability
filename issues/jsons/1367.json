An unused import statement was removed from the test module (Thanks @ThiefMaster).\n\nI feel that having `scripts` as a top-level package simplifies usage of the tool and also allows for further command line tool development downstream.

If you are going to have users install RedBaron just to use the script, why not have them install the script instead? It would be easier to have a command like `flask_ext_migrate <source>.py` rather than having to directly reference the script, which requires users to first find the location of the Flask installation on their machine (right?).\n\nAdditionally, having it as a separate package will make it easy to deprecate its use, rather than having a script buried in the Flask source.\n\nThoughts?\n"
