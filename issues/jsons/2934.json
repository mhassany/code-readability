    "body": "1. If attachment filename is bytes type and contains non-ascii coded bytes,\r\nthen the following ASCII encoding process will raise a ``UnicodeDecodeError`` exception.\r\n\r\n2. Since the following exception handling uses ``unicodedata`` for normalization, this also implies that the attachment filename is a ``unicode`` when encoding .\r\nhttps://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/363205bdc3abcfeed08c7e85e397fb7a7dc9ef07/flask/helpers.py#L570-L577\r\n\r\n3. Since ``UnicodeDecodeError`` exception was raised, we can see that an ASCII decoding process was also performed implicitly when encoding bytes string. So this solution won't introduce unnecessary overhead.\r\n\r\nfixes #2933 "
