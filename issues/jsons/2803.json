I would be using \"flask.request.files\" to process this file.\r\n\r\nBut what if I do not have any forms on the site that upload files... what I have noticed and provided a file for to duplicate the issue ... is in the event of an audio file POST upload to a form processor that does not have a control to process files... ie \"flask.request.files\".... the \"flask.redirect([route])\" fails... \r\n\r\nLine 61 of the sample file is purposely left commented out...to demonstrate the redirect failure... by removing comment and enabling ...\"posted_files = flask.request.files\" .... the redirect magically works again...\r\n\r\nThere seems to be an issue in the fact that an audio file is being posted... the same test run with images file formats entered into line 40.....ie.... accept=\".jpg, .png\" do not effect the redirect... \r\n\r\n[flask_error.zip](https://github.com/pallets/flask/files/2043603/flask_error.zip)\r\n\r\nIn case anyone is interested....
