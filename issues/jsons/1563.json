It shouldn't be persisted across multiple separate requests.\n\n**My auth handling**\nWhen you visit the resource a token is used to determine who you are.  Once we get the user_id from that token we persist it like the below code.\n\n``` python\nif '_auth' not in g:\n    g._auth = Auth(user_id=user)\nreturn g._auth\n```\n\n**Test Setup**\n\n``` python\ndef test(self):\n    get = self.client.get('users', headers=make_headers())\n    raise Exception(g._auth.user_id) # returns the user id outside the request context\n```\n\nAny ideas as to why `g` would be available?  Let me know if you need more information.  I wasn't sure how much to include.\n",
