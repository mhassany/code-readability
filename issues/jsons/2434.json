I can't replace all the function names by `_`, say, because then Flask complains\r\n\r\n    AssertionError: View function mapping is overwriting an existing endpoint function: _\r\n\r\nI could replace all the handler function names with their underscore-prefixed equivalents, i.e. change `index` to `_index`, etc..  Is there another idiomatic way of dealing with this problem?\r\n\r\n([I also asked this question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45214742/idiomatic-way-to-stop-pylint-complaining-about-flask-route-unused-function-names) but got no responses.)\r\n",
