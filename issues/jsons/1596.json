After calling `url_for` with a specific `_scheme`, this scheme will become the default scheme in the current context's url_adapter.\n\nBest demonstrated with a small example:\n\n```\nimport flask\n\napp = flask.Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    return 'Hello World'\n\n\nwith app.test_request_context('/'):\n    flask.url_for('hello', _external=True)\n    # http://localhost/\n    flask.url_for('hello', _external=True, _scheme='https')\n    # https://localhost/\n    flask.url_for('hello', _external=True)\n    # https://localhost/\n```\n\nI would expect the first and third call to return the exact same result.\n\nPR contains a test demonstrating the issue and a proposed fix.\n",
