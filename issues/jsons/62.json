(You should definitely use that word in the docs.) The only thing I can think of for 0.5 is being able to create additional exports of static files and reconfigure the template loader, because right now those are pretty hardwired into the core of Flask. If you could do that, it would be just about everything the extensioneers need to make everything else an extension.\n\nAs for the issue of splitting into a package itself, I'm fine either way. I don't think Flask is too big for a single module (it's pushing it, though), but there are benefits to the package format - especially if it does grow more.\n"
