            "body": "> The fix seems easy, but Flask/Werkzeug have already far too much cruft accumulated that results in accepting workarounds like these. I also don't think that Python 3 currently has a userbase big enough for our workaround to matter, which would probably be released when it's already too late and Ubuntu has updated its Python 3 package.\n\nAgree completely.\n\n> a documentation change should happen (at least) because I spent a hefty chunk of time tracking this issue down.\n\nThanks for tracking this down! \n\nThis issue (including the [monkey-patch solution](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1011#issuecomment-109494761)) should suffice for docs as it's easily found by googling the error message. For now, I'm going to go ahead and close this. If any of the other maintainers disagree, feel free to re-open.\n"
