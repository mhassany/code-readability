In URL path, path is '/' delimited, but in file path it can be '\\' delimited.\n\nMy solution is to define a custom converter class `FilePathConverter` that uses `urllib`'s `pathname2url` function in its `to_url` method.\n\nThe test suite is also updated to support the change by adding a `os.path.normpath` conversion in requested static path.\n",
