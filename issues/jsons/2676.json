    "body": "This is a complete rewrite of the tutorial, both the docs and the example code. The goal is to provide a better foundation for new developers to work with. There's  a bit more code, and it's a bit more complex, but I'm hoping it sets up patterns and concepts better so that developers start with better habits.\r\n\r\n* Use the application factory and blueprints from the start.\r\n* Use the instance folder for config and the database.\r\n* Multiple users, stored in the database with hashed passwords.\r\n* Delete posts.\r\n* Build a Wheel file, install it in another virtualenv.\r\n* Override `SECRET_KEY` using config in the instance folder.\r\n* Use other WSGI server in production (Waitress, since it works on Windows).\r\n* 100% test coverage using pytest and coverage.\r\n* All described code links to the API docs.\r\n* General reorganization.\r\n\r\nI've removed all the other examples. I'm going to add a JavaScript example back in but wanted to rewrite it as well. That will be the next PR. The other examples are all covered by the tutorial now.\r\n\r\nAdded a `gh` Sphinx role that adds links to GitHub files. It will select the correct tag on GitHub based on the docs version being built. I'll expand this to work with issues and extract it to pallets-sphinx-themes at some point.\r\n\r\nYou can find the rendered docs here: http://flask-dev.davidism.com/tutorial/. The only change is in the installation instructions, Flask needs to be installed from GitHub since 1.0 isn't released yet. You can find the example project on my branch: https://github.com/davidism/flask/tree/tutorial/examples/tutorial.\r\n\r\ncloses #2513 ",
