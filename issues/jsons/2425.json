Further, I had no idea that it was even possible to install a package into my venv and have auto-reload automatically work (`pip --editable .`). I just wanted to set some env vars and run `flask run` and have it work. What I was shooting for in the paragraph I added in the PR is: \"don't panic, when your webapp is a package (instead of a top-level hello.py script), you must install it and that's just part of the dev process\". I'm fine with that explanation, and I think the reader will be as well (at least, where they are for now, in chapter 3 of the tut).\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that later, during deployment, when the instructions say something like, \"so, install your webapp package into...\", then the reader will be pleased to know that they already have their webapp set up as a package, and that this is one of the reasons it was useful to set that up in chapter 3 of the tut.\r\n"
