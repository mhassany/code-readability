Summarizing:\n- This PR expands and clarifies documentation around teardown functions, including a stronger warning that users must ensure teardowns don't raise, even teardowns registered by Flask extensions.\n- @ThiefMaster pointed out that the warning seemed off-putting for new users.\n- @jeffwidman and I agreed: paraphrasing, the warning sounds less like an explanation of a feature and more like a workaround for a bug. That said, maybe there _is_ a bug, and maybe the right thing to do is fix it: in other words, maybe Flask should handle teardown exceptions in a more robust way.\n- @jeffwidman is +1 on merging this now as long as we make a new issue to track improved handling of teardown exceptions, and asked @ThiefMaster for thoughts.\n- @untitaker asked @mitsuhiko for the reasoning behind the current behavior.\n"
