    "body": "If you\u2019re using the interactive debugger in the web browser, and autocorrect is feeling aggressive, it can kick in and try to \u201cfix\u201d the Python commands you\u2019re typing. This is annoying for the end-user, and rarely helpful as autocorrect doesn\u2019t know about Python. More than once this has bitten me, causing me to write invalid Python, or for variable names to change case mid-command.\n\nI don\u2019t have time to create a patch now, but I think the fix is just adding the following attribute to the `<input>` tag where you type commands:\n\n```\nautocomplete=\"off\" autocorrect=\"off\" autocapitalize=\"off\" spellcheck=\"false\"\n```\n\nThis probably isn\u2019t really Flask\u2019s fault \u2013 the OS is what actually makes the unhelpful autocorrections \u2013 but it seems like something Flask should be able to fix.\n\nI spotted this on the developer builds of OS&nbsp;X Sierra, where autocorrect seems noticeably keener (especially in `<input>` fields) than older versions.\n- Python 3.5.0\n- Flask 0.11.1\n- Werkzeug 0.11.10\n",
