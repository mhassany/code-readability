This is bc of the fact that the readme specifies using the new `FLASK_APP` with an app factory pattern. That feature is not supported in the 0.12.2 release. So installing directly from `examples/flaskr/` does throw an error.\r\n\r\nAside from waiting for a new release, you could create an `wsgi.py` file or the like, in the flaskr example to instantiate the application. I suppose the best thing to do is mention both ways in the readme. \r\n\r\nAlso a lesser issue I ran into is that this: `export FLASK_APP=flaskr.factory:create_app()`\r\nShould be this: `export FLASK_APP=\"flaskr.factory:create_app()\"`\r\nOtherwise I get this: `syntax error near unexpected token `('`"
