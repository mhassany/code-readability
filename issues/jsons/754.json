    "body": "I believe the issue was fixed on the Werkzeug side, but I think there still may be a bug in Flask.\n\nWhen I have a url of the form /someurl/<name>, where name is non-ascii (specifically, cyrillic), my app does not fetch the right template/file. It works fine under Python 2.\n\nIf I have a top-level URL of the form /\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442, and attempt to access it, I get a 404. I believe Werkzeug handles the request correctly, but I don't know at which point it gets mangled into something which doesn't get me to the endpoint (for example, <Request 'http://localhost:1111/\u00d1\u0082\u00d0\u00b5\u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u0082' [GET]>). That last bit is UTF-8 which is for some reason rendered as ISO-8859-1.\n\nAny suggestions as to where in the framework (either Flask or Werkzeug) this could be happening?\n",
