    "body": "The sweet web app console built into [Firebug](https://www.getfirebug.com) is easily accessible to JavaScript programmers via `console.log()`. The [FireLogger](http://firelogger.binaryage.com) extension lets server-side languages like PHP and Python write directly to the same console. In Python's case, via the [FirePython](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/FirePython) module. \n\n<a href=\"http://static.binaryage.com/c079fa5c_shared_img_firelogger4php-mainshot-full.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://static.binaryage.com/ddfd1510_shared_img_firelogger4php-mainshot.png\"></a>\n\nUnfortunately, Python integration is web-framework specific. Django is directly supported; Flask is not. FirePython already supports WSGI, so using it with Flask / Werkzeug should be straightforward. But it's not--at least not for me. The documentation basically says \"read the source and figure it out.\" Given that I'm a complete novice with Flask's WSGI underpinnings, my efforts have flopped around without success.\n\nSo this is a request to those in the Flask community who are conversant with WSGI, Werkzeug, and `logging` to have a look and provide a recipe for how to link these individually great, but as yet not-talking-to-one-another, components. Looking at the code, I'd bet there's a <15 lines of code incantation that would do the trick; I just can't see the right permutation. \n\nFWIW, this is the opposite of a one-off support request; easy Firebug logging would make an awesome app debugging facility for many Flask / webapp developers.\n",
