    "body": "Hi everyone, question here.\nI have complex flask application with several Flask instances dispatched by werkzeug middleware. And in such situation I have two questions related not actually with url_for, but with flask context management actually.\n1) How do I create url from one application to another?\n2) Main one - how do I create url for specific application with no app_context at all. For example i need to create some url on import time or from celery task. I tried to do wrapper over all application instances and redefine url_for like\n\n```\ndef url_for(self, *args, **kwargs):\n    with self.app.app_context():\n        return url_for(*args, **kwargs) \n```\n\nbut just received following error\n\"Application was not able to create a URL adapter for request independent URL generation. You might be able to fix this by setting the SERVER_NAME config variable.\"\nAny suggestions?\n",
