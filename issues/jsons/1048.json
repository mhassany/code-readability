I can't tell you exactly the steps that I went through this time other than I certainly was after the stable version, and I installed from the tar.gz.\n\nFor whatever reason pip install does not work for me. My current environment is windows, I have dlls and c code in the process.\n\nI chose not to pursue the pip issue given that install via \"python setup.py install\" appeared to work. It may have. User error has yet to be ruled out.\n```\n\nRegardless, I will reinstall flask.\n   I understand from the above that the 0.10.1 is latest stable version and that all install processes at the very least get me working source code in the example directory and in documentation.\n   I'll report what I find.\n"
