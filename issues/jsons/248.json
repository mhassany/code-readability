Both projects have either deprecated or already removed such features. In general automatically generating anything users can interact with using a non-whitelist method is likely to cause information leakage, unauthorized writes and may provide a vector for DoS attacks.\n\nIf that isn't obvious to you (as you might have gathered it is, to several other people), you should educate yourself on basic security measures when writing software in general and web applications in particular. Reading about security issues (Django has excellent documentation on those) can also be very helpful.\n"

This \"security feature\" is only designed to warn web app developers that, if your users are running old IE, attack sites can read JSON responses that they shouldn't be able to read.  If you don't care about old IE users leaking data, possibly because your site explicitly disallows IE8 entirely, you can disable it.\n\nThe purpose of my patch is to make this protection more explicit and understandable, and not prevent other useful things.\n"

I'm of the opinion that we should _not_ change the default behavior of _Flask_ from what it is right now. So we should continue to raise an exception, if a list is passed to jsonify().\n\nThe fact that IE7 is outdated alone, may be sufficient reason for a developer to stop ensuring that a website looks as intended or is even usable in IE7. It's not a sufficient reason to not ensure that these users remain safe. Flask users can always override this decision but we should go with the conservative option for the framework itself.\n"

The only time you'd want to load JSON data in a browser is in an XHR, and XHRs can easily set the X-CSRFToken header.  Also, the only time you'd leak private information is if you're using cookies.  So one way to implement the same security measure would be:\n\nIf all of these apply:\n- The request contains a session cookie\n- The request method is GET (or any other method, really)\n- The response type is application/json\n\nThen:\n- Ensure the X-CSRFToken header is set correctly\n\nAnyway, I'm curious to see if people can reproduce the exploits in any browsers than anyone still uses.  Anyone have old IE?\n\nI guess the point of the existing implementation was to ensure the output is always an object because anything beginning with `{` fails to parse as javascript, since it is interpreted as a block instead of an object.  In light of this, perhaps I should change the implementation to ensure the response starts with `{` instead of preventing it from starting with `[`.  But that may not be necessary if there's no way to hijack a string or integer.\n"
