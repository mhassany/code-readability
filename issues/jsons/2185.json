My problem is that I can only make a few successful requests per minute, then the service would have a Connection Timed Out error after. I would have to wait for a couple of minutes to make successful requests again.\r\n\r\nThe application is an SMTP service.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts/help is greatly appreciated.",
