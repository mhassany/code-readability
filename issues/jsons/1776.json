Should Flask have a generic hook for extensions to add support for additional third-party shells? \n   If so, how would this work? @RonnyPfannschmidt suggested using entry points for this.\n\nMy vote is to natively support for iPython since it's so popular (I use it myself all the time via Flask-Script). But draw the line there and require other custom shell integrations to happen through third-party extensions.\n",
