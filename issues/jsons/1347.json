    "body": "See https://github.com/graup/flask-restless/blob/post-excluding-id/tests/test_manager.py#L568. Here we are trying to catch an exception using the `nose.tools.raises` decorator. On Python 3, we seem to be running into an issue with Flask's extension import redirect.\n\nThe issue is that when the exception gets raised (in https://github.com/graup/flask-restless/blob/post-excluding-id/flask_restless/manager.py#L484), it gets raised as an instance of `flask_restless.manager.IllegalArgumentError`, not as an instance of `flask.ext.restless.manager.IllegalArgumentError`. This can be verified by the code below (if you have the source code for Flask-Restless available in your current working directory):\n\n```\n>>> from flask.ext.restless.manager import IllegalArgumentError as E1\n>>> from flask_restless.manager import IllegalArgumentError as E2\n>>> E1\n<class 'flask.ext.restless.manager.IllegalArgumentError'>\n>>> E2\n<class 'flask_restless.manager.IllegalArgumentError'>\n>>> E1 is E2\nFalse\n```\n\nNow when nose tries to check for a raised instance of `flask.ext.restless.manager.IllegalArgumentError`, it doesn't find one, because the raised exception is really an instance of `flask_restless.manager.IllegalArgumentError`. What I would expect to happen is that `E1 is E2`.\n",
