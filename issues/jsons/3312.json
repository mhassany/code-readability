I guess pallets/werkzeug#1416 is a good writeup of *some* of the the behavior I've encountered recently, but it's not something I want to subject most users to reading. If you have a reference to add, I'm happy to consider a PR, but I'm going to close this for now."

If that makes since to you, would be happy to open PR.\r\n\r\nSorry if the ticket came off snarky. What I'm getting at here is that this section of the docs proposes a big leap for someone with a basic Flask app:\r\n\r\n* refactoring project directory structure\r\n* moving the app obj to `__init__.py` (a non-trivial piece of Python import's system to understand)\r\n* adding `setup.py` (which a newer developer might typically hear about in the context of distribution and `distutils`)\r\n\r\nGiven the big leap, felt like the existing explanation didn't sufficiently sell the necessity of making such changes. \r\n\r\nI realize the Flask docs have been trying to [walk the line between friendly-for-newcomers and scalable project structure](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2626) since the rewrite for 1.0. My bias is friendly-for-newcomers; I realize it's a bias and hopefully am not being dismissive of other perspectives here.\r\n\r\nEither way, thanks for responding, and thanks for passing along that Werkzeug ticket; really shows how hairy the problem can get :)"
