If so, why pull from itsdangerous? Why not just implement in flask itself and be done with it? itsdangerous' code for it is trivial:\n\n```\ntry:\n    import simplejson as json\nexcept ImportError:\n    import json\n```\n\nThis is particularly important to me since simplejson supports `Decimal` and the built in json module does not (at least not in Python 2.7).\n\nI know I'm getting a little off the topic for this issue, but have you considered just making it a dependency instead of making it optional? I had the rather strange experience of observing _different behavior_ for `Decimal` just because I had simplejson installed in my virtualenv. My fellow developer did not, and so my code was broken on their machine and not mine.\n"
