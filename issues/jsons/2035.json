That is partially how flask decides which kind of instance folder to return:\n\n```\n\"package_path\"/var/\"name\"-instance\nor:\n\"working_dir\"/instance.\n```\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/pallets/flask/2035)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",

Putting the project folder in the env folder is incorrect, the env should either be completely separate or inside the project folder.  It would be useful to test the instance path for an installed package, but this test is just covering up incorrect directory structure.\n"
