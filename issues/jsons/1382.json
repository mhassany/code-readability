I want to log requests (user page views) to a database, but I don't want to compromise the client experience regarding speed. So I would like to only log the request data to a DB after the data was successfully sent to the client\n\n![flask signals](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2236950/6657010/363efcde-cb1c-11e4-8d12-2b70d72fa59b.png)\n",
