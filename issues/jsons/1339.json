    "body": "Issue #348 \n\nI want to separate an app with various blueprints, frontend, backend, etc.. But when I try to register my frontend blueprint with follow code, my static css, images, js don't load.\n\n``` python\nfront = Blueprint('front', __name__, static_folder='static', template_folder='./templates', url_prefix='/')\n```\n\nAfter debugging I found the problem. It's when try to register route, it tries to register route like //static (https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/flask/blueprints.py#L68)\n\nAnd then when use url_for the werkzeug routing.py (https://github.com/mitsuhiko/werkzeug/blob/master/werkzeug/routing.py#L1655) resolve url_for //static/filename it found a problem beacause there are two rules like this: \n\n``` python\n[<Rule '/static/<filename>' (HEAD, OPTIONS, GET) -> static>, <Rule '//static/<filename>' (HEAD, OPTIONS, GET) -> front.static>]\n```\n\nSo, a simple solution like concatenate a `blueprint.name` before url_prefix when is \"/\" resolve this conflict and now we can  use `url_for('front.static', filename='2.jpg')` routing resolves without problem.\n",
