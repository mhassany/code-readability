    "body": "So, this tries to address the ability to easily add commands to blueprints, and let them get stacked into the applications cli group in one of three ways.\r\n\r\nThe default is nested, with name taken from the bp name, giving you `flask user create`:\r\n\r\n    bp = Blueprint('user', __name__)\r\n    bp.cli.command('create')\r\n\r\nOptionally you can override that grouping name, giving you `flask librarian create`:\r\n\r\n    bp = Blueprint('user', __name__, cli_group='librarian')\r\n    bp.cli.command('create')\r\n\r\nOr, you can specify `None` as the group, which applies it directly to the root app's cli group giving `flask add_user`:\r\n\r\n    bp = Blueprint('user', __name__, cli_group=None)\r\n    bp.cli.command('add_user')\r\n\r\nThe tests show each of these options.  Let me know your thoughts and I'll add the documentation changes required if everyone think's it's useful to proceed.\r\n\r\n`cli_group` can also be specified when registering on the app: `app.register_blueprint(bp, cli_group=\"librarian\")` to override the bp level `cli_group` choice.\r\n\r\ncloses #1357 ",
