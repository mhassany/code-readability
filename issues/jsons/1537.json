For example, given the following extension setup:\n\n``` text\nextension/\n    __init__.py\n    some.py\n    extension_details.py\n    templates/\n        extension/\n            base.html\n            some-page.html\n```\n\nbefore this patch, overriding `base.html` would simply have been a matter of:\n\n``` text\nthe-app/\n    __init__.py\n    templates/\n        the-layout.html\n        extension/\n            base.html\n```\n\nAnd making sure that `base.html@the-app` had the necessary `block` and `import` declarations.  This would shadow `base.html@extension`, allowing the app developer to override what the extension was doing without the extension developer having to provide a hook for such an overload\n\nWith this patch, I don't think there is a way to override `base.html@extension` in `extension` without patching Flask to bring back the old behavior (which will result in a lot of issues if new extensions start depending on this behavior).\n"
