The commit message you have is much less ambiguous and would be a good PR title as well.\n\nTo address the suggested change, it is meant to be implied that the code provided in that subsection is part of the same module defined above in the \"The Testing Skeleton\" subsection. Therefore an import statement is not necessary. Notice how the sample code in the \"Logging In and Out\" and \"The First Test\" sections similarly does not include import statements.\n"
