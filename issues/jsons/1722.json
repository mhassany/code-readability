The section is entitled What to Use Flask for and When to Use It. As the name suggests, the new section attempts to explain in plain and straightforward language what Flask is used for and when one should use it.\n\nOther repositories may begin to use this new informative section soon, as my colleagues contact open-source technologies in an effort to make them more accessible to the many new users learning to code and GitHub every day.\n\nThank you for your consideration, I look forward to hearing your response. \n",

This was part of a school assignment to\nunderstand GitHub but also to attempt to provide a general overview section\nfor the curious or novice to programming.

It was not my intention to introduce opinion or\ninaccurate information.\n\nDo you think there would be value to having such a contribution, if the\ninaccurate / opinion information could be taken out?\n\nI'm sure the readme is fine for some segments of people, but do you think\nthat it could be improved to enhance comprehension for a wider audience?\nI'm not sure if gaining a wider audience is one of the project's interests\nso I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts as one of the projects core\ncontributors.\n\nBest regards,\nStu\n\nOn Tue, Feb 9, 2016 at 11:22 AM, David Lord notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> This doesn't feel like a significant improvement to me, and some of the\n> new information is either inaccurate or just opinion.
