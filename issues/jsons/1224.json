It is not until 2 Ctrl + C, that it goes to 0.0.0.0, then I still receive a 404 error in my browser.  I do have routes that are valid when running locally. I have tried to create a new virtualenv and i still recieve the same error, I reset the firewall rule on this application.  All effort that did not return rewarded.\n\nAny Ideas onto why my app makes an attempt to startup on the localhost first then moves over, but then returns a 404?\n",
