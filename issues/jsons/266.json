            "body": "I just ran into this issue today - not the documentation issue posted by OP, but the one referred to in the stackoverflow question linked to above, and discussed later on in these comments. I agree with @Trii - overriding a blueprint's template from below it on the tree makes sense, but it seems wrong that templates from different blueprints conflict with each other. When you're loading a template with `render_template` from within a blueprint, why would the other blueprints' `templates` folder be included from the search path? Is it _useful_ to be able to override a blueprint's templates from another blueprint?\n\nReading and thinking more, I think I've figured out how it works: there is a global namespace for templates, and each blueprint's templates folder is at the root of that namespace. It's a simple system, which is nice, but it means that if you want to have your templates in their own namespace, you have to put them in a subfolder whose name is unique to the blueprint. In practice you use the name of the blueprint. I guess that's not _that_ bad -  the structure of most ruby gems are like this, for example, with `Foo::Bar::Baz` being in the file `foo/bar/baz.rb`. If your are creating a blueprint named `admin`, you only have to move your templates one folder deeper, from `admin/templates/` to `admin/templates/admin/`. For the cases that I've run into so far, it would be more intuitive to have files in `admin/templates` just be **assumed** to be in their own `admin` namespace already. But it's not too big a deal.\n\nThe bigger issue is that, in order to refer to a template for your blueprint under this system, you have to use the template's global name (`admin/home.html` in this case). This means a lot of repetition of the blueprint name in files inside the blueprint, from `render_template` calls in python, to `include` and `extends` tags in jinja. It would be nice if we could avoid all that repetition.\n"
