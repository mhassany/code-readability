    "body": "closes #1151 \r\n\r\nMostly keeps the same sections and concepts. References to old version behavior is removed since it's no longer relevant. Added more explanation about what to do about \"no app / request context\" errors, since it comes up constantly on Stack Overflow. Added more cross references and cleaned up many API docs as well to make them more consistent. Added documentation for `_AppCtxGlobals` rather than recreating it in the `g` docs. Added documentation about the `test_request_context` arguments.\r\n\r\nThis is an inherently advanced topic, so I don't think there's any way to make it completely clear to all readers. Hopefully it's at least easier to follow to get an idea of how the process works."
