Is there an intention to document the support for this flag? This is a great feature, but from the user's perspective it is currently very hard to even figure out how it works. I propose at least keeping an issue alive with information on which environments will support it.\r\n\r\nHere is what worked for me:\r\nFlask 0.12.2 + Gunicorn 19.7.1\r\nFlask 0.12.2 + Werkzeug 0.13\r\n\r\nWhat did not work for me\r\nFlask 0.12.2 + uWSGI 2.0.15",
