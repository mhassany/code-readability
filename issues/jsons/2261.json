    "body": "I'm doing some work which requires defining some context hooks for our flask app. When reading the documentation for [request contexts*](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/dev/reqcontext/#callbacks-and-errors) I came across the passage:\r\n\r\n>>> In production mode if an exception is not caught, the 500 internal server handler is called. In development mode however...\r\n\r\nAs a user, I want to know: What is 'development mode?' I _think_ it's debug mode (e.g. `app.run(debug=True)`). I've seen several people use the terms interchangeably when searching for help, but not either the flask developers or the official documentation. The flask docs don't appear to have an index (is it hidden somewhere?), and quick search does not appear to work. Google site search of the dev docs does not immediately turn up an obvious answer.\r\n\r\nIMO, this is a bug in the documentation. Assuming for the sake of argument I'm right about dev=debug, that passage should be either:\r\n\r\n0. \"In development mode (i.e. with `debug=True`) however...\" or\r\n1. The text 'development mode' is a link to a list of terms & their definitions\r\n2. Something along those lines.\r\n\r\nMaybe if I had carefully read all of the docs from beginning to end, or at least carefully read the tutorial twice, I might not be confused about this. But lots of your users won't do that. That's why I call it a bug (it's sorta like failing to validate input).\r\n\r\n*I was in fact reading the docs for the version of flask I'm using, but pointing to dev-version docs b/c I presume they represent the current state of the documentation",

I'd basically be repeating what you told me & assuming it's correct (and maybe you're just fucking with me for the lulz), but also speaking _ex cathedra_ to the Flask n00bs of the world, who deserve to have their docs written by somebody who knows what he's talking about (to the extent that they deserve anything with a free project, but still).

For consistency, I think the mode should always be called \"debug mode\". I think calling the opposite of debug mode \"production mode\" is also a bit misleading, since this is a mode that you can certainly run on the Flask development server, which is not meant to be used in production.\r\n\r\nSo regarding your question @dradetsky, in my opinion there is just \"debug mode\", and it can be on or off, regardless of the server being the builtin one or uwsgi, gunicorn, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple more references to \"production mode\" and 'development mode\" in the docs besides the one you found that I think would also benefit if they are rephrased in terms of debug mode."
