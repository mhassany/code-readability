It seems like there was some rearranging at some point and this was probably overlooked, so this should fix the broken links and make a better experience for others browsing the docs. :slightly_smiling_face: \r\n\r\nAdditionally, in an oversight, I missed the contributing guidelines in the root directory of the repository but I did scan the README. When I came back to this, I found the contributing guidelines, but I would have noticed them quicker and submitted this PR a day earlier if I had seen them mentioned in the README. So I thought an explicit call-out to the existing contributing guidelines (which were well-written and very helpful to me) in the README might be useful for others too.\r\n\r\nI successfully ran the tests on the docs and I was able to build them locally on my workstation.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nCommit checklist:\r\n\r\n* add tests that fail without the patch\r\n* ensure all tests pass with ``pytest``\r\n* add documentation to the relevant docstrings or pages\r\n* add ``versionadded`` or ``versionchanged`` directives to relevant docstrings\r\n* add a changelog entry if this patch changes code\r\n\r\nTests, coverage, and docs will be run automatically when you submit the pull\r\nrequest, but running them yourself can save time.\r\n-->\r\n"
