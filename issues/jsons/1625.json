Perhaps if the screen grab showed & highlighted the console icon on the far left of my screen, that wouldn't have happened.\n\nI'm happy to submit a pull request with a replacement screenshot if you agree this would be useful, noting I'm not on mac, so screen grab might look out of place, if that detail is considered important\n",
