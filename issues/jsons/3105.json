I'd tested env vars corresponding to the other `flask run` options and they didn't work (e.g. `FLASK_RUN_DEBUGGER`, `FLASK_RUN_EAGER_LOADING`, `FLASK_RUN_WITH_THREADS`), I thought I'd tested `FLASK_RUN_CERT` and it didn't work either but I clearly missed that, sorry! I don't see this documented so I'll try to submit a docs PR if no one beats me to it.\r\n\r\nIs it intentional that FLASK_RUN_\\* env vars for those other options don't work, or am I missing something there too?\r\n\r\nOT but relatedly, is it intentional that it's --eager-load*ing* but --lazy-load*er*?"
