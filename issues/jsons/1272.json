    "body": "The latest Flask release is 0.10.1, which is close to 18 months old now (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask/0.10.1). \n\nA lot of work has been done since, including a new CLI this summer, which I find personally very useful, and many many small fixes.\n\nI believe that the plan was to make a 1.0 release from the current code base. I don't know if there are still blocking issues in this respect.\n\nIf there are blocking issues, maybe it's time to mark them as such on the GitHub issue tracker. It would also help some people, I think, if another 0.x release was made in the interim.\n\nI see on https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/CHANGES that a 0.10.2 release was also planned with only fixes. In that case, maybe it would be time to to it (if this is still convenient) and do a 0.11 if it's not possible to do a 1.0 in the short term.\n",
