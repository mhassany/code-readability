    "body": "I wanted to serialize objects using `for_json` methods, but I found it cumbersome to pass the `for_json=True` argument to simplejson when using Flask's `jsonify` method. Since there are other useful overrides during (de)serialization, I propose that Flask's config-object should be able to override all json options. The already supported ascii, sort_keys, prettyprint and indent-options are still supported, and take precedence over any new values.\n"
