The Sijax library throws a `RuntimeError` the first time json is used, if it couldn't find a json implementation ( https://github.com/spantaleev/sijax-python/blob/eb2c8fbb92386b361093863692a4ec4a4ca7e2cb/sijax/helper.py#L17 ). If `simplejson` has to be listed as a requirement in `setup.py` maybe that needs to happen in Sijax anyway, and not in this Flask extension.\n"
