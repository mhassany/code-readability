A blueprint does not \"own\" a certain URL segment, even when using `url_prefix` which I believe you do. The reason for this is simple: It's perfectly valid to have the same `url_prefix` on multiple blueprints since it simply gets prepended to the path specified in the `route()` call.\r\n\r\nWe have no intentions of changing this behavior, as it would possibly break all kinds of use cases in bigger apps.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think we should consider adding a way of registering an error handler for a base URL so you could do something like `@app.errorhandler(NotFound, path='/api/')`"
