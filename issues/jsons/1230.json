Also, since single backticks have an ambiguous meaing and might be rendered completely different with different parsers, I think that double backticks are more correct in every sense, and i don't think i've ever seen a project which intentionally uses single backticks for this purpose.\n\nI'd welcome a PR which does the opposite though, convert single to double backticks.\n"
