The reason for putting it after the code examples, was that the text at that point has shown the reader how to set up an error handler for 404 errors and I thought the tip about status=500 fitted in after that. But that's not a big deal, the most important thing is that the note is in there, it should save others some head scratching reading through various bug reports/discussion threads through Google.\n\nAs for other status codes: I haven't encountered others so far. Don't know the flask source code, but from the look of `handle_exception(self, e)`, it looks like `500` is the only thing that receives special attention.\n"
