For example file `\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442:\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442_\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442.py` gets downloaded in Chrome/Safari as `__.py` but in Firefox as `\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442_\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442_\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442.py` which is acceptable in my opinion.\r\n\r\nFlask response:\r\n`Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*=\"UTF-8''%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82:%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82_%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82.py\"; filename=\":_.py\"`\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: 2.7.15\r\n* Flask version: 1.0.2\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.14.1\r\n",
