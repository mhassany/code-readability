    "body": "The function I designated as `@app.teardown_appcontext` is running before the view code runs - at least according to my own investigations. Printing something in `teardown_appcontext` and something in a view body results in the former appearing before the latter, at the very least. Using `teardown_request`, however, works as expected.\r\n\r\n[From the documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/api/#flask.Flask.teardown_appcontext), I would've expected `teardown_appcontext` to fire at roughly the same time (\"These functions are typically also called when the request context is popped\"), except it'd also work with `with app.app_context`. It seems that's not the case, however!\r\n\r\nI'm on Python 2.7.12 with Flask 0.11.1 and Werkzeug 0.11.11.",
