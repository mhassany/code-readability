And most of it is just internal error messages from Flask, which don't tell me anything. 99.9% of the time, I'm just interested in the line which led to this error which is located in my own scripts. If I know that, I normally can quickly find the solution, but all the other output just confuses me.\n\nSo; is there a way that I can just output the lines in my own written scripts that led to the error?\n",
