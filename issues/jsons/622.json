    "body": "Hi, I recently wrote an extension for making it easy to serve all your app's static assets from Amazon S3. It's called [flask-s3](https://github.com/e-dard/flask-s3); the docs are located [here](http://flask-s3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)\n\nWould be great to have this extension included in the extension registry. I think that it meets all the requirements, but let me know if it's missing anything.\n",
