    "body": "Originally i intended to rewrite the error handling system to register an\nerror handler for each subclass of HTTPException on initialization of the\nFlask object, removing the distinction between HTTP exceptions and other\nexception types. However, with the current behavior of preferring the\nfirst-registered handler when an error occurs, doing this without compromises\nwould require changing this to preferring the last-registered handler, a\nbackwards-incompatible change.\n\nThe following is a very minimal fix to only make Flask prioritize the user's\nerror handlers over others. I am not sure which performance implications this\nhas. Maybe a major rewrite of the error handling system is still desirable\n(with more complex prioritization of errorhandlers -- something based on\n\"distance\" in inheritance tree?), but at the moment i don't see a reason to do\nso, given that the current system is primitive enough to be understandable,\nwhile still usable.\n",
