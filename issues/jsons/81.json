    "body": "When app.yaml has `static_dir` point to Flask application's `static/` directory, `os.path.exists` will always return `False` and thus causing `_PackageBoundObject.has_static_dir` to return `False` making static URL rule not being added at initialization. \n\nExample:\n#### app.yaml\n\n```\napplication: demo\nversion: 1\nruntime: python\napi_version: 1\n\nhandlers:\n- url: /static\n  static_dir: static\n\n- url: /.*\n  script: app.py\n```\n#### app.py\n\n```\nfrom google.appengine.ext.webapp.util import run_wsgi_app\nfrom flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef demo():\n    return str(app.has_static_folder)\n\ndef main():\n    run_wsgi_app(app)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nThis will return `False` but will return `True` once I comment out the static handler. Current workaround is to add static rule myself, using `app.add_url_rule(app.static_path + '/<path:filename>', endpoint='static')` of sort. It would be nice of Flask detects GAE and add the static path anyway.\n",
