I understand the desire to have a minimalist readme, I just suggested a different approach.\r\n\r\nI have the impression that people do not give much attention to LICENSE unless it is highlighted alongside the contributors or if is somewhere in readme. Neither is the case of this repo.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that this is a problem or necessarily bad. I believe it is important to read the license before using the software or modifying it.\r\n\r\nThat's why i suggested the section like in my first commit."
