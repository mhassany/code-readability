I played around with it some more and now have a much better understanding of where I went wrong.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this PR only involves stylistic changes for readability then. Based on other PRs, it looks like that may not be a valid reason for introducing changes. However, I'd be happy to squash my commits to reduce history bloat if the moderators like them."
