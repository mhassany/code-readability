It would be more productive to just remove mention of distribute and call this \"Deploying with Setuptools\".\n\nI'm not clear why you removed the section discussing the benefits of setuptools.\n\nI don't think we need to mention `ez_setup.py`, since as was pointed out earlier in the doc, Flask already depends on `setuptools`, but if you do want to mention it, you've used a very outdated link, the correct one is https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py.\n"
