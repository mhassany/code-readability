The idea here is that we no longer try to map the development mode from the production mode by the `DEBUG` setting. This is intended because we want users to be able to are in a non debug development mode.\r\n\r\nThe docs are updated to largely refer to `FLASK_ENV` only.\r\n\r\nOne change to node is that we default to production instead of defaulting to development. This is done because most people will not set the environment and we do not want users to accidentally have debug features on.\r\n\r\nThis refs #2569",

My current thinking is that separately we should do a few changes to the run command to make it make sense in production.\r\n\r\nThe first one I think makes sense that for `FLASK_ENV` != `development` it should print a scary warning to stderr and point out that it's bad. Additionally it should really have a configurable backend one can hook in. In particular I think it would be great if it can automatically spawn a uwsgi through a plugin which is really what most people do at this point."
