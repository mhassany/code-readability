The removal of `test_url_generation_requires_server_name` is because the error case it covered no longer exists.\n",

All the calls to `url_for` happen in views (during a request context), or in `@async` decorated tasks, which wraps them in a request context. So the original function works fine as is.\r\n\r\nThe linked issue is about something slightly different, but the comment at the end outlines a less radical change that would still fix it. Closing this in favor of that."
