Overall looked good, I mostly just moved things around.\r\n\r\n* Use `subdomain` arg in `url_map.bind_to_environ` rather than resetting it afterwards.\r\n* Rename the new test to be more descriptive.\r\n* Parametrize the new test instead.\r\n* Test the use case described in the issue, which was allowing subdomains when server name is set. (Still tests IP too.)\r\n* Add `subdomain_matching` param to docs, add some references, add version changed to `create_url_adapter`.\r\n"
