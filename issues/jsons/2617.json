    "body": "I am trying to send a csv file as a base64 encoded string in the body of a post request to a flask server. It works find for small files. But when I try to post a file above ~150k the server does not respond and there is no error message. It seems to get hung up on `body = request.get_json()`. This non-responsiveness happens through postman and node. To throw a wrench into the problem, I can submit the file fine using pythons requests library. I am not sure what is causing this or what the difference between the three requests. The headers all look really similar and are included in the repo. I have included the minimal server (server.py), working python request (test.py), the not working node request (jstest.js) and the not working postman collection. Thanks for any help.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple reproduction MCVE https://github.com/mdemin914/flask-largeish-csv-file-error-reproduction\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: 2.7.13\r\n* Flask version: 0.12.2\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.14.1\r\n",
