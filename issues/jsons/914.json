I think I once saw a little list of good sites using Flask, but I can't find them anymore.\n\nAnybody any tips?\n",

I'll be mainly building this part (an internal website) on my own, with maybe others joining in later. Seeing that I have experience in it, it makes sense for me to build it in Python (and Flask). I know that others will take over in a later stage, but that shouldn't withhold us to choose a technology in which prototyping is blazingly fast, and which is simply awesome (I know, my opinion).\n\nAnyway, no tips for nice websites which use Flask?\n"
