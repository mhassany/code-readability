            "body": "One thing is that it you're not using a virtualenv, this is the recommended situation: this is not the problem here but it will make debugging easier for you. I'm assuming you `git clone` the flask project and `cd` into `examples/minitwit`. Then I guess you run `pip install -e .`. Then `export FLASK_APP=minitwit`. I think the issue is probably you were missing `pip install -e .`, it's missing from the README and should be there. But if you follow that procedure it should work. \r\n\r\n- minitwit's readme needs to be updated to be like flaskr's readme and include `pip install -e .` step."
