    "body": "If an URL rule has more than one handlers for different HTTP methods (typical for RESTful apps), OPTIONS will incorrectly report only the methods of the first handler.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n```\n@app.route('/things/<thing>')\ndef one_thing(thing):\n    return \"it's a \" + thing + \"!\"\n\n@app.route('/things/<thing>', methods=['PUT'])\ndef put_thing(thing):\n    return \"Thanks for the thing.\"\n```\n\nPerforming an OPTIONS request on /things/foo incorrectly reports only the methods of the first handler:\n\n```\n$ curl -IXOPTIONS http://localhost:8080/things/foo\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nAllow: HEAD, OPTIONS, GET\n...\n```\n\nWerkzeug gets it right though, if an invalid method is attempted:\n\n```\n$ curl -IXFOO http://localhost:8080/things/foo\nHTTP/1.0 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED\nContent-Type: text/html\nAllow: PUT, HEAD, OPTIONS, GET\n...\n```\n\nI figure something along the lines of MapAdapter.match() in werkzeug/routing.py is required (loop through all matching handlers and add up the supported methods)\n\nThanks :-)\n",
