Will Flask run it for me?\r\n\r\n\r\n* Step 2\r\n\r\nThat \"import ... g ...\"\" looks like a typo. I left it out until I\r\nread step 4.\r\n\r\n\"The SECRET_KEY is needed...\"\r\nWhat do real systems do? No need to go into details, just mention\r\nsomething. SHA1? SSH keys?\r\n\r\n\r\n* Step 3\r\n\r\n\"Flask is now shipped with built-in support for Click.\"\r\nThat's nice I guess, but what does it have to do with anything else\r\nin this step?\r\n\r\n\"A useful pattern to manage a Flask application...\"\r\nWhy? Will it make deployment in my production environment easier? To\r\nother people? What happens if I don't?\r\n\r\nIt would be better if the text said which directory to use\r\nbefore the command\r\n\r\n\r\n* Step 4\r\n\r\n\"def get_db():\"\r\n\r\nLooks like an unsafe singleton. Does Flask use threads or processes?\r\n\r\n\"Hint: Where do I put this code?\"\r\n\r\nI'd been using Flask for 30 minutes, I had no idea where to put the\r\ncode. This should be at the start.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Step 5\r\n\r\n    (flask) /home/hugh/Flask/Tutorial/flaskr/$ flask initdb\r\n    Usage: flask [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\r\n\r\n    Error: No such command \"initdb\".\r\n\r\nHmm, function has to have same name as in decorator?\r\nNo\r\n\r\nMaybe the command is really flask --initdb?\r\nNo\r\n\r\nHave I screwed up the environment var?\r\n    $ flask run\r\nThat seems to work.\r\n\r\n(And yes I worked out shortly afterwards that this is an illusion, trying\r\nto load a page will throw a \"does not appear to exist\" exception.)\r\n\r\n    $ cd flaskr\r\n    $ flask initdb\r\nAha!\r\n\r\nGeneral note: having two identically named dirs is confusing, need\r\nto be clearer about where you should be at each step\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful exercise that could be added:\r\n\r\nIf you want the second database attribute, the blog entry HTML, to\r\nbe named \"body\" instead of \"text\", how many files do you need to edit?\r\n\r\n",
