    "body": "The test suite is a bit of a mess as far as how each test sets up an app context, request context, etc.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice to DRY this up using pytest fixtures.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n1. More readable tests.\r\n2. Tests are easier to write.\r\n3. Tests are easier to refactor.\r\n3. Tests are more robust because it's easier to run a test with multiple parameters.\r\n\r\nThis is a large project, but easy to tackle incrementally. Perhaps it should be broken into multiple issues, as each section of tests requires some specific fixtures, for example `jsonify()` tests require some specific `json` setup.\r\n\r\nRelated: #2286 \r\n\r\n"
