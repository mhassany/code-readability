However, I don't think Werkzeug's `Map.bind` expects a port either, since 1.) the parameter is also called `server_name` 2.) `server_name` [is then idna-encoded](https://github.com/untitaker/werkzeug/blob/b617036ff9173fdc527177493ac518dae01503b4/werkzeug/routing.py#L1245), which is nonsensical for host + port combinations and actually breaks for certain hostnames:\n\n```\n>>> 'foobar:443'.encode('idna')\n'foobar:443'\n>>> 'f\u00f6\u00f6bar:443'.encode('idna')\nb'xn--fbar:443-n4aa'\n```\n\nHowever, apparently `app.run` derives its default port from `SERVER_NAME`.\n\nThis is so broken...\n"
