    "body": "Any errors that occur inside `request_context` are not properly caught by `handle_exception`. From app.py:\n\n```\ndef wsgi_app(self, environ, start_response):\n    with self.request_context(environ):\n        try:\n            response = self.full_dispatch_request()\n        except Exception, e:\n            response = self.make_response(self.handle_exception(e))\n            return response(environ, start_response)\n```\n\nAs an example, create an error handler for error code 500. Set `config['SERVER_NAME']` to something your client won't send, and visit the application. The call to `url_map.bind_to_environ` in `RequestContext` results in a ValueError from werkzeug.\n",
