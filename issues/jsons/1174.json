I was going to run `git clean -fdx` to get a pristine clean environment to build from, but it crashes:\n\n```\nthiderman@dragonisle ~/git/piper venv:piper(master:+6) \n> git clean -fdx -n \nWould remove .coverage\nWould remove .tox/\nWould remove argparse-1.2.1-py2.6.egg\nWould remove bin/\nfatal: Not a git repository: /Users/mitsuhiko/Development/flask/.git/modules/docs/_themes\n```\n\nIf I remove `docs/_themes/.git` it works. git autodetects it and thinks that it's a submodule, and since my computer is not @mitsuhiko's Mac machine it kinda fails. :P\n\nCould this file be excluded from the tarball? I can't really see that it serves a purpose, and it breaks my project in an unexpected way.\n",
