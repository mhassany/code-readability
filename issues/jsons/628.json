The failure is expected, though, since by default the server is run in single-threaded, single-process mode and will simply not be able to cope with all incoming connections of course.\n\nThe `run` method https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/flask/app.py#L712 accepts a whole lot of options that get passed on to the Werkzeug server https://github.com/mitsuhiko/werkzeug/blob/master/werkzeug/serving.py#L604 these options include `processes` `threaded`.\n\nGive these settings a try and I'm sure you'll find the server to be a little more satisfying toy. Let us know how it goes. And, of course, don't use it in production.\n"
