I run a Debian Distro kernel 4.4.x on a beagleBone Black Wireless.\r\n\r\nI am using Adafruit_BBIO for software to hardware connections. Adafruit_BBIO is basically a Rasp. Pi build for the BBB with PWM, i2c, UART, ADC, and others.\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior of the Program:\r\n\r\nThis software runs a Flask app to allow me to know when, while online via 192.168.7.2:5000, someone has opened my door and for how long.
