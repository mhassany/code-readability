    "body": "Under the URL Building section. I read,\n   \"Reversing is often more descriptive than hard-coding the URLs.\"\n\nAnd I thought, \"I have been asleep while reading again\". So I did a search on the Quickstart, and this is the first instance of the term \"reversing\" in the text. I couldn't make any sense of \"reversing'\". Worse how could it be more descriptive when I have no idea what it is. After searching a bit, I suggest the following minor change to text at the beginning of the section.\n\nReplace:\n\"If it can match URLs, can Flask also generate them? Of course it can. To build a URL to a specific function you can use the url_for() function.\" \n\nWith:\n\"If Flask can match URLs, can it also generate them? Of course it can.  To build a URL for a specific function you can use the url_for() function. This is called reversing the view.\"\n\nDo I have this right?  Django at least talks about functionality that is similar to what you are talking about here. Terminology is never an exact match across similar tools. So if my suggestion is not correct, then it is demonstration of how I came to the wrong conclusion.\n\nRegards, Flask is definitely cool.\n-m\n",
