Primarily I thought we could add a sentence to make n00b web-devs aware of the existence of server-side sessions and they can google if they want more. \n\nAlso, I don't know what our policy is on recommending specific extensions, I'm generally a little hesitant because there's no guarantees about them being maintained. In particular for sessions, even when the extension is well-maintained, there are potential security implications if anything is amiss... for example https://github.com/mbr/flask-kvsession/issues/25#issuecomment-223740448\n"
