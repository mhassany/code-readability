It'd be super confusing if stable docs referenced features that aren't in the stable version.\n\nThat said, I still think this PR belongs in the stable docs. The app context teardown functionality is already present, documented, and widely used, in the current stable release (0.10.x). This PR fixes an omission in that existing documentation: I think there are plenty of Flask 0.10.x users who don't know how much trouble can be caused by allowing a teardown function to raise, or what to do to prevent it. In that sense, I think it _is_ a bugfix, even if it's not in the actual code and doesn't result in a new stable version.\n"

            "body": "@untitaker It's definitely a grey area. If the documentation was completely wrong (like saying a parameter defaults to `False` when it actually defaults to `True` or something), I'd consider that worth a release. OTOH something like a typo is definitely not worth a release. I also agree a major change to the document structure, breaking links & stuff, would be bad. But I only added sections, I didn't remove or rename any, so existing links should be fine.\n\nIdeally, I'd like to see this PR make it to the docs on flask.pocoo.org, without needing a tag or PyPI release. I was hoping that merging it to the maintenance branch, without tagging the merge commit, would accomplish this. Then again...I have to admit that's a weird thing to do. \"All maintenance branch changes result in a new tag & release\" sounds like a reasonable rule, and this PR breaks that rule.\n\nOf course, this is your repo, not mine, so in the end the decision is yours :D I'm also glad to see an organization taking some of the weight of Flask & friends off of mitsuhiko. Major thanks for taking on that responsibility!\n\nThat also raises a question: off the record, given the repo changing hands, can we expect new Flask releases in the near future, say a year or so? I'd feel better about merging this only to `master` if I knew it would see stable release relatively soon.\n\n**TL;DR:** Are there any next actions for me here? I can close this PR and reopen against `master`. Or just let y'all do the cherry-picking/merging and closing.\n"
