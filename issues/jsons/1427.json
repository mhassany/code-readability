    "body": "Hey there,\n\nI don't know if anyone ran into this problem before because it works \"by chance\" in py2, but in py3 you can't send temporary file with `send_file` by passing a fp.\n\nThe main problems are here https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/flask/helpers.py#L477 and there https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/flask/helpers.py#L496.\n\nUnder py2 a `tempfile.TemporaryFile` is given the name `'<fdopen>'` whereas under py3 it's an integer.\n\n```\nPython 2.7.9 (default, Dec 15 2014, 10:01:34)\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.56)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from tempfile import TemporaryFile\n>>> fp = TemporaryFile()\n>>> fp.name\n'<fdopen>'\n```\n\n```\nPython 3.4.3 (default, Mar 23 2015, 04:19:36)\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from tempfile import TemporaryFile\n>>> fp = TemporaryFile()\n>>> fp.name\n4\n```\n\nThen when Flask tries to build `filename` it crashes (trying to concatenate a string and an integer in `os.path.join(current_app.root_path, filename)`).\n\nWould you consider merging a workaround for this problem? (like setting `filename` to `None` if we don't have a `string_types` for instance)\n",
