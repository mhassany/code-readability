    "body": "Multiple issues including #248 call for jsonify to handle lists.  As discussed there, allowing toplevel arrays should pose no security problem nowadays.  A config parameter is added to enable this functionality, and a list is jsonified only when no `kwargs` is given to maintain backwards compatibility.  In short, when `JSONIFY_ALLOW_TOPLEVEL_ARRAY` is set, `jsonify(1, 2, 3)`, `jsonify([1, 2, 3])`, `jsonify(question='Ultimate', answer=42)`, and `jsonify({'question': 'Ultimate', 'answer': 42})` all work as expected.  Note that `jsonify(1)` produces `\"[1]\"`, which may or may not be wanted.\n"
