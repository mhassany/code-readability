    "body": "Hello,\n\nI added 4 functions to the Flask class that make routing basic http request easier. Now you can write:\n\n```\n@app.get('/')\ndef get_index():\n    pass\n\n@app.post('/')\ndef post_index():\n    pass\n\n@app.put('/')\ndef put_index():\n    pass\n\n@app.delete('/')\ndef delete_index():\n    pass\n```\n\ninstead of having to write methods=['POST'] in _route_. This makes writing RESTful api a lot cleaner.\n\nThere are also tests for these methods in the _HTTPRoutingTestCase_ class in testsuite/basic.py.\n",
