    "body": "It's my curse to discover documentation ambiguities ( even when they don't exist ) and then trip over them.\n\nWhen I read, (step 2 of flaskr tutorial)\n\n\"Usually, it is a good idea to load a configuration from a configurable file. This is     what from_envvar() can do, replacing the from_object() line above:\n\n```\napp.config.from_envvar('FLASKR_SETTINGS', silent=True)\n```\n\nThat way someone can set an environment variable called FLASKR_SETTINGS to specify a config file to be loaded which will then override the default values. The silent switch just tells Flask to not complain if no such environment key is set.\" \n\nI took that to mean, \"Replace that 'from_object\" instance. Well no. The text does not say that but I did anyway and debugged for a while until I removed the silent option, saw the noise and realized that that line would not work as described in this context.\n\nIt is a good point. Configuration files are good. I would box this into a \"Note:\" That concludes with a, \"Do not replace this line now.\"\n\nSimpler of course would be to omit entirely. Another alternative is to leave as a problem for the reader at the end of the section.\n\n(Documentation is hard - there are too many personally costumized mental OS's out there to ever possibly fully debug docs)\n",
