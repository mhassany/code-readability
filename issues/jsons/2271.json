    "body": "I created a Sphinx extension, [sphinxcontrib-log-cabinet](https://github.com/davidism/sphinxcontrib-log-cabinet), to handle #1704. It collects each group of changelog directives, sorts them newest to oldest, then collapses all logs older than the current version. Deprecations are never collapsed.\r\n\r\nThe extension is optional, a warning is printed if it's not installed but the build continues. The flask-docs build script needs to be updated to install this if we want it to actually take effect.\r\n\r\nThe collapse doesn't work on IE because they don't support `<details>`. A later version can add a polyfill for it, but I'm not too concerned."
