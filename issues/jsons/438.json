Folks who are new to flask regardless of their Python experience? Right now, this is a good foreword for the first group: its examples cover advanced topics that newer users won't understand, and whose only effect will be to scare those users. I would recommend splitting the foreword into two parts: (1) For new users (2) For experienced coders. This first portion would cover, in broad strokes, Flask's philosophy: convention over configuration, what \"micro\" means, \"simple tasks should be simple\", etc. The second portion, which we may want to hide on another page, will cover the implementation details of Flask's design decisions that advanced users will want to know about, such as the use of thread-local objects.\n\nIf that's a structure the community feels good about, I'd be happy to draft it up.\n",
