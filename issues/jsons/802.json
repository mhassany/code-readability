    "body": "Dear Flask-Team,\n\nthanks for the good work. I have been using Flask for quite a while now.\nIn my project I use flask to receive requests from a command line client.\nThe server is running with an adhoc SSL context. The client sends a SSL client certificate which I need to parse in the request handler.\n\nIf I use a web server (e.g. nginx) to dispatch the request to Flask, I can configure the request environment to include the client certificate like so:\n  `fastcgi_param CLIENT_CERT $ssl_client_cert;`\n  `fastcgi_param CLIENT_RAW_CERT $ssl_client_raw_cert;`\n\nNow, I want the same behavior when I run the development server (or any other mean to get the client cert).\nCurrently I am starting the app server like so:\n  `self._app.run(host=host, port=app_port, ssl_context='adhoc', debug=True)`\n\nCan you help?\n",

            "body": "Hello @motine,\n\n`app.run` passes the `ssl_context` argument to `werkzeug.serving.run_simple`. And in fact it is described in Werkzeug's documentation: http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/serving/#quickstart\n\nSo what you have to do is to pass a tuple of the form `('/path/to/the/key.crt', '/path/to/the/key.key')` instead of the string `\"adhoc\"`.\n\nAs a side note, the issue tracker is usually not the appropriate place to ask usage-related questions. It doesn't help that GitHub calls it \"issues\" while it's usually called a \"bug tracker\", and that there are currently relatively little ways available (StackOverflow and the `#pocoo` channel on freenode) for asking a question about Flask _with the chance of getting a response_.\n"

So i think the best you can do in development is to just use nginx in dev too. Actually that doesn't seem like such a bad move, you could configure nginx in upstart, systemd or whatever to start as part of the boot process. Then you start the development server at any time on the port you configured nginx to proxy to.\n"
