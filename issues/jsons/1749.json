    "body": "I was surprised to see that though flask.json.JSONEncoder accepts datetime objects, it ignores the timezone. I checked werkzeug.http.http_date and it can handle timezone aware dates just fine if they are passed in, but the JSONEncoder insists on transforming the datetime to a timetuple, like this\n\n `return http_date(o.timetuple())`\n\nThis means i have to convert all my dates to utc before encoding them, otherwise I should overwrite the dafault() method in the encoder. Can you help me understand why the encoder was made to function with naive dates only?\nThx\n",

However, the `.timetuple()` call throws away the timezone information, leading to incorrect output (the correct numerical value with `GMT` tagged on).\r\n\r\nRemoving `.timetuple()` in https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/master/flask/json.py#L75 would fix this error, while leaving the behaviour for naive or UTC-`datetimes` unchanged."
