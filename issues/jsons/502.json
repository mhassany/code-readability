Here's an alternative:\nhttps://gist.github.com/2480050\n\nAs it stands right now, we may pull JSONP from the Flask core, and prefer leaving it for an extension.  The reasons being:\n1. the API for the padded jsonify is a bit awkward with bool or str as possible values, and the str case being either a request arg or a function name\n2. modern browsers do not need JSONP\n3. JSONP would benefit from CSRF protection, which could use the Flask-SeaSurf extension\n\nJSONP support is currently not released in Flask, only in master.\n"
