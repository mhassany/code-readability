    "body": "Flask only logs in debug mode.\n\n`handle_exception` raises an exception in debug, else returns an `InternalServerError` and logs the exception.\n\nExcept that by default, it can't log the exception because it's in debug.\n\nThis is mostly just an annoyance as long as you are running with `run_simple`, as the Werkzueg debugger will log the exception that got re-raised in `handle_exception` and provide you with a great debugging interface. However, if you switch to a different WSGI engine, you end up with no way to see a traceback.\n\nIn app.py handle_exception:\n\n```\n    if self.propagate_exceptions:\n        # if we want to repropagate the exception, we can attempt to\n        # raise it with the whole traceback in case we can do that\n        # (the function was actually called from the except part)\n        # otherwise, we just raise the error again\n        if exc_value is e:\n            raise exc_type, exc_value, tb\n        else:\n            raise e\n\n    self.log_exception((exc_type, exc_value, tb))\n    if handler is None:\n        return InternalServerError()\n    return handler(e)\n```\n"
