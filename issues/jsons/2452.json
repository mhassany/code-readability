Thanks for that!\r\n\r\nA quick improvement would be to highlight the blocks which represent user's code. I believe this would give a decent speed boost when recognizing where errors come from. I think this could be as simple as giving a light red-tint on any code boxes which comes from the file defined in the FLASK_APP variable.\r\n\r\nThis would be unobtrusive, and would help speed up use for many users.\r\n\r\ne.g. we could highlight this line:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/328294/29567073-ffdc8b52-8743-11e7-95fd-be26eb6c93be.png)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the call trace could automatically collapse the 'app runner' code which the user is likely uninterested in.\r\n\r\nApologies if this place is for bugs only (not features)\r\n",
