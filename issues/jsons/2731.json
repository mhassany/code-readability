    "body": "This is a major backwards-compat breaking change, but I suspect not the intended design and hopefully easy to fix.\r\n\r\nThe issue is related to PR #2629, and this example follows from that:\r\n\r\nGiven blueprint `bp` and app `app`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@bp.route('b/')\r\ndef tmp():\r\n    return \"URI should be '/a/b/\"\r\n\r\napp.register_blueprint(bp, url_prefix='/a/')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Flask 0.12 the URL is correctly `/a/b`, but in Flask 1.0 it's `/ab`.\r\n\r\nSince issue #2629 relates to resolve double-slashes, I imagine this is a bug (and not a design decision) - and the correct solution would be to remove a slash only when there are two.\r\n",
