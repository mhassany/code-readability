Alternatively, just have a simple note that says something along the lines of:\n\n> Deprecation note: Flask 0.8 deprecated `flask.ext.foo`. If you want to develop an\n> application that supports Flask 0.7 or earlier, see this [note about using `flaskext_compat.py`](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/extensions/#flask-before-0-8).\n\nLinking to the old docs should provide enough context on flask.ext.foo.\n\n3) Along those lines, should the script `flaskext_compat.py` be removed from the 1.0 release master branch? Neither that nor the `flask-07-upgrade.py` script seem necessary anymore since they're available through the maintenance branches.\n\n4) Should the following paragraph be deleted from `extensiondev.rst`?\n\n> Flask sets up a redirect package called :data:`flask.ext` where users should import the extensions from. If you for instance have a package called flask_something users would import it as flask.ext.something. This is done to transition from the old namespace packages. See :ref:`ext-import-transition` for more details.\n\n5) Should the following line be deleted from `extensiondev.rst`?\n\n> Flask 0.8 introduces a redirect import system that lets uses import from `flask.ext.foo` and it will try `flask_foo` first and if that fails `flaskext.foo`.\n\nLeaving this in might accidentally encourage users to use `flask.ext.foo` as a catchall solution. I don't see any reason to leave it in, as the section reads fine without it. \n\nI would happily submit a PR to implement the above changes except I'm not 100% confident on the proper solutions to these issues. Feel free to either implement changes or let me know the desired solutions and I'll fix them. \n"

If we remove this section maybe more docstring text should be added to `flaskext_compat.py`.\n\n> 3) Along those lines, should the script flaskext_compat.py be removed from the 1.0 release master branch? Neither that nor the flask-07-upgrade.py script seem necessary anymore since they're available through the maintenance branches.\n\nNot sure... if yes, the additional text mentioned above should be added in the maintenance branch. I'd say the change would be a bit radical, a safe thing to do is to rename it to make room for the new fixer. We also could extend the current compat tool so that it can do all kinds of conversions (the default being that it would convert `flaskext.foo` and `flask.ext.foo` to `flask_foo`).\n\n> 4) Should the following paragraph be deleted from extensiondev.rst?\n> \n>    Flask sets up a redirect package called :data:flask.ext where users should import the extensions from.

I don't see any reason to leave it in, as the section reads fine without it.\n\nIn general i'd rather just convert information to the past tense instead of deleting it... maybe we could move all information about flask.ext into just one chapter, and link this chapter sometimes for historic reasons, but not leave mentions of flask.ext scattered.\n"
