    "body": "**This issue tracker is a tool to address bugs in Flask itself.\r\nPlease use the #pocoo IRC channel on freenode or Stack Overflow for general\r\nquestions about using Flask or issues not related to Flask.**\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to report a bug in Flask, fill out the template below. Provide\r\nany extra information that may be useful / related to your problem.\r\nIdeally, create an [MCVE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve), which helps us\r\nunderstand the problem and helps check that it is not caused by something in\r\nyour code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm working on a large Flask project. Occasionally, Flask will give me an ImportError, for example the following:\r\n\r\n```pytb\r\nNoAppException: While importing \"application\", an ImportError was raised:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/fintan/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flask/cli.py\", line 235, in locate_app\r\n    __import__(module_name)\r\n  File \"/Users/fintan/Dropbox/LearnerShape/server3/application.py\", line 1, in <module>\r\n    from learnershape.app import *\r\n  File \"/Users/fintan/Dropbox/LearnerShape/server3/learnershape/app.py\", line 4, in <module>\r\n    from learnershape import core\r\n  File \"/Users/fintan/Dropbox/LearnerShape/server3/learnershape/core/__init__.py\", line 2, in <module>\r\n    from . import views\r\nImportError: cannot import name views\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I restart the server, the error goes away and Flask runs perfectly.\r\n\r\nDo you think this could be due to a) a bad import structure, b) Flask not reloading modules correctly, c) .pyc files?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nFlask should only show an ImportError when there is a problem with module imports.\r\n\r\nThis problem occurs at least twice a day, but I haven't been able to get it to occur yet in a minimal version. If anyone has time to look into this, I can add you as a collaborator to our repository.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nFlask shows an ImportError which persists until Flask is restarted, then goes away.\r\n\r\n```pytb\r\nNoAppException: While importing \"application\", an ImportError was raised:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/fintan/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flask/cli.py\", line 235, in locate_app\r\n    __import__(module_name)\r\n  File \"/Users/fintan/Dropbox/LearnerShape/server3/application.py\", line 1, in <module>\r\n    from learnershape.app import *\r\n  File \"/Users/fintan/Dropbox/LearnerShape/server3/learnershape/app.py\", line 4, in <module>\r\n    from learnershape import core\r\n  File \"/Users/fintan/Dropbox/LearnerShape/server3/learnershape/core/__init__.py\", line 2, in <module>\r\n    from . import views\r\nImportError: cannot import name views\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: 2.7.11\r\n* Flask version: 1.0.2\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.15.2\r\n",
