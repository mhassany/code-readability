However, with the exact same request while using sentry it failed every time.  \r\n\r\nSeems to be an issue with sentry?\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nFigured it out, I didn't have the content type set in my jquery requests.  I was using get_json(force=True).   Which was fine until I added sentry.  Apparently the behavior of get_json changes when you use sentry.\r\n\r\nTo fix I just added this to my jquery ajax request:\r\n\r\ncontentType: \"application/json\""
