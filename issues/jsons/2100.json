    "body": "Hi everyone, i have been seeing this issue some days intermittently.\r\n\r\nI have some methods with request.method = POST, but when i want to resend the same request to the same endpoint, there is an issue with the request.method and Flask throws Method not Allowed.\r\n\r\n`@app.route('/api/pause', methods=['POST'])`\r\n`json = {\"signature\":\"1234\", \"value\":\"b\"}`\r\n\r\nThe first time was good and data was printed on console: `print request.json`\r\n\r\nbut the second time (i am doing the requests from Postman and this time i have changed value for a) i can see this on log:\r\n\r\n`{\"signature\":\"1234\",\"value\":\"b\"}POST /api/pause HTTP/1.1\" 405 -`\r\n\r\nthe third time i can see this on log:\r\n\r\n`{\"signature\":\"1234\",\"value\":\"a\"}POST /api/pause HTTP/1.1\" 405 -`\r\n\r\nSo, i do not know why Flask is inserting the previous POST values at the request.method and of course it throws Method Not Allowed, because pause method has not this allowed.\r\n\r\nNote: I tried with or without threaded Flask option.\r\n\r\nDo you know why i have this problem ? It is so important because i can not create a good API without POST or PUT as you would think.\r\n"
