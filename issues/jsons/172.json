    "body": "Currently Flask calls the blueprint for reusable thingies \"Module\" which is a terrible name because it already has a lot of meaning in Python. Because Modules also need to be pimped we should consider introducing a new concept altogether with a new name and phase out modules.\n\nFor all changes that are backwards incompatible we should consider that people hate updating their code so at the very least provide a script like the werkzeug import rewriter.\n\nRelated feedback issues:\n- http://feedback.flask.pocoo.org/message/10\n- http://feedback.flask.pocoo.org/message/21\n- http://feedback.flask.pocoo.org/message/99\n- http://feedback.flask.pocoo.org/message/117\n",

Not that that _should_ matter, but maybe it does.\n\nOtherwise my preference is still with `Component` or maybe `Flasklet` (sounds better, but more correctly it is `Flasket` which is an actual word for a small flask).\n\nThe best solution would be to have a single view container type that is composable, though Armin claims this is difficult to get right. Perhaps decouple configuration from view collections? That's bordering on becoming Pyramid of course, though maybe Flasky shortcuts could be added to streamline the simple cases.\n"
