    "body": "I recently had some trouble with trying to add dynamic parameters (at runtime) using url_for, because it requires specific method parameters. This is especially useful if you want to set additional HTTP GET parameters easily.\n\nI decided to go for a dict-based approach, where the _runtime parameter for the url_for method would inject a few extra url_for parameters at runtime.\n### Included\n- Changes to url_for to add this functionality\n- Testcase for this functionality\n### Usecase\n\nI needed a way to generate URLs to endpoints with additional GET parameters based on the current page's GET parameters. More specifically, for paginated search results (where the search query is a GET parameter).\n\nWith this change, you can use the following:\n\n``` python\nurl_for('search', page=page, _runtime=request.args.to_dict())\n```\n\ninstead of having to resort to ugly hacks or extra libraries to append the runtime parameters to the generated URL.\n",
