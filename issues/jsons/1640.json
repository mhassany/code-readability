    "body": "I was surprised when running my application from the CLI that it didn't respect the applications debug flag.  This patch expands `DispatchApp`'s api to return the applications debug flag which is used by `run_simple` to activate the debugger and supply an informative message.\n\nI explored enabling the reloader along with enabling the debugger but that caused a double execution. If I understand it correctly, the double load is the result of `eager_loading` not being switched properly because the reload status (if activated by the applications debug flag) wouldn't be known until after loading has occurred.\n\nSince I am not positive what side-effects (none to my limited understanding) double execution would have I left that code out; it is a trivial addition if a double execution is acceptable in this case.\n",
