As far as I can see has flask currently just one mailinglist http://flask.pocoo.org/mailinglist/ \narnuschky suggested to create an other list: the flask announce mailing list. Creating one is not the problem (list at librelist.com), it is just that you end up maintaining two mailing lists. (Which suggest to me more work and less cake\u2026). Yes, you can automate what you send out but somehow is a new release is actually a good time to celebrate or at least have a chat why you should get going to install the update made by the team. \nThe team in charge of this communication would be the release manager. They would give people who have not been in touch with the current software status indicator why they should trust that the time and effort of updating, leads to an more awesome flask installation.\n\nuntitaker I agree that an announcement on the list is enough for people who are actively involved e.g. contributor but this might not be the case for all people that are in charge of a flask installation. So the question is,  how could release manager encourge an faster uptake for non contributor flask installation maintainer.  Time for tea.\n"

You'll follow your OS vendor/distribution announce mailing lists, and the lists of each individual software package that are installed on the various systems. In our case, flask is one of them. I won't follow the \"normal\" mailing list as it has several messages a day - not much for a discussion list, but too much when it's one list out of 20 you'll follow only because of security updates.\n\nIf there exists a robust way using git tags or similar to catch security updates, fair enough, I'll hack up a script. But currently there is no solution, as far as I see it.\n"
