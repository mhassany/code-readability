On a badly formatted request, the URLs in the API blueprint will be parsing JSON (using `Request.json`) and should return JSON responses (possibly using `Request.on_json_loading_failed`), but bad requests to URLs in the other blueprint should respond with regular old HTML responses.\n\nIn this case the user should be able to set a custom `Flask.request_class` _for the API blueprint only_ which overrides the `on_json_loading_failed` method.\n",
