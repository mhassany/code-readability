Do not use it in a production deployment.\r\n>    Use a production WSGI server instead.\r\n>  * Debug mode: off\r\n>  * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: 3.7.3\r\n* Flask version: 1.0.3\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.15.4\r\n\r\nYes I realize that in the API documentation it explicitly says this won't work, yet it used to in older version of flask (at least when using app.run()). Perhaps this is more a of feature request?",

I'm lazy ok. :P Plus I don't really want to learn OS specific setup commands (exporting variables is different on each OS)  when I can just run it natively in Python. I mean my code totally works. It hacks the FLASK_ENV directly from Python then lets me run it with `flask serve`. I'm curious why you don't just build that in to `flask run`?
