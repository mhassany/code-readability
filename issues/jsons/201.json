    "body": "Hey Armin -\n\nI've update the extensions dev documentation as we discussed at the first sprint session.\n\nAs a reminder, the idea here was to make sure that the docs didn't recommend putting things like db objects on the g object in an extension - and especially not using before_request or after_request.\n\nWhat I've tried to do is use patterns from the sqlalchemy extension. The one difference is a kind of \"manager\" pattern where the initialized extension returns a manager that has the db connection on it.\n\nLet me know if this works for you. Obviously, I'm open to reworking if needed.\n\nMatt\n",
