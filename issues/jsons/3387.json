    "body": "I just upgraded the macOS to 10.15 (Catalina) on my MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015) and encountered a weird issue:\r\n\r\n1. I'm running a python flask app on local area network which worked fine before the upgrade, but other people could not access to my server now;\r\n2. With Wireshark, I know the TCP SYN requests was received but not responded; And the flask server did not received the request at all;\r\n3. I started a simple TCP server with a python script in terminal. By allowing Python.app to access to the network on a pop-up, this simple TCP server could be connected by others;\r\n4. If I turn down the firewall on macOS, the flask server could be connected by others;\r\n5. In the firewall configuration, the Python was allowed to access to the network; And there was no pop-ups to allow the network access when I started the flask app;\r\n\r\nAnything i missed?\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* macOS 10.15\r\n* Python version: 3.7.2\r\n* Flask version: 0.12.2\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.14.1\r\n",
