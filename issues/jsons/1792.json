I'm currently using a slightly ugly hack (*) to have virtual folders for blueprints inside the merged template folders which means IDEs like PyCharm won't be able to link templates nicely since they don't know about it - with something builtin into Flask that'd probably change.\n\nBut even with blueprint-local templates it'd be important to keep the ability to access other templates (at least from the main app) from a blueprint template, e.g. to inherit from a base template or to include common macros - so using completely separate jinja environments most likely won't be an option.\n\n---\n\n(*) See the `virtual_template_folder` code in https://github.com/indico/indico/blob/master/indico/web/flask/wrappers.py#L173 for the hack I'm using.\n"
