But because sessions setting works a little bit different (cookie is reset if information is written) the only working solution would be to store the expiration information inside the session directly.\n\nEg: session['max_age'] = timedelta(days=30) or session['expires'] = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=30). Not sure how to decide about that, will consider something.\n"
