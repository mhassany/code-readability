The command to install the pre-commit hooks is not set as a code block and is rendered as a quote.\r\nAs someone who decided to make a few contributions on the framework, this is a quite irritating start of the journey \ud83d\ude04 I've added a link to the official guide for the installation of the pre-commit and fixed the markdown to make the command a code block."
