What I do in my own development workflow is to never use `FLASK_DEBUG`, and I don't see a need to adopt `FLASK_ENV` either. If I want the reloader, I use `--reload`, and if I want the debugger I use `--debugger`. Better to be explicit. When I convince people to forget about \"debug mode\" and use what they need, confusion goes away."

Maybe that's not the right way to go about this but the issue with setting things like `DEBUG` in the config is that way too much stuff initializes too early. More importantly a lot of stuff that is debug related just can't access the config yet because it's not there.\r\n\r\nSo not sure if we can ever make `DEBUG` work well in the config unless we re-initialize things on config change."

I sort of stopped thinking about the debugger and the reloader as \"debug mode\" things, and instead consider them separate options that you can enable when you need them.\r\n\r\nWith this way of seeing things, the `FLASK_DEBUG=1` option enables, three things by default: the reloader, the debugger, and debug mode in the application. So setting debug mode in the application does not imply that you are using the debugger & reloader, just that `app.debug==True`. Not sure if I can convince you to look at things this way, but at least for me it clears most of the confusion around these options, and makes `DEBUG` perfectly safe to stay in the configuration."
