    "body": "Hello, \n\nI was wondering if there was a specific reason that the ability for Flask to deployed to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk was not something that was captured here in the QuickStart guide. \nhttp://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/#deploying-to-a-web-server\n\n...specifically the ability to deploy Flask in Beanstalk is documented in this location in AWS' documentation. \nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_Python_flask.html\n\nIt seems like a nice, more direct help for folks if the Quick Start just had a link to the AWS documentation. I'd be willing to make the change to the QuickStart myself if that would help. \n",
