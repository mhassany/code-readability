    "body": "Hi\n\nWhen calling a flask webserver from angularjs, you get `method not allowed` and `content-type not allowed` errors. This is because the flask OPTIONS response does not specify `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` and `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` by default.\n\nThis is fixed by following code fragment:\n\n```\n@app.after_request\ndef apply_caching(response):\n    response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = 'Content-Type'\n    response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Methods'] = 'GET,PUT'\n    return response\n```\n\nIs the exclusion of these headers intentional or is this a bug? I think a lot of people call Flask from angularjs, so supporting these headers by default might be good for adoption and ease of use?\n\nKind regards\n",
