We debugged the problem, For our HTML page Rquest cookies don't send 'session cookie', So we are Receiving  session cookie in 'Response Cookies'\r\n\r\nThe logic here used is if we not send session cookie, server returns session cookie in response as per our understanding.\r\nSo can anyone help why there is session cookie not received in response for first time of a day in a HTML page or is that cookie expired and due to that we are facing this problem?(Note: we are not using any cookie expiration time using default value)\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: 2.7.3\r\n* Flask version:0.12\r\n* Werkzeug version:0.11.15\r\n",
