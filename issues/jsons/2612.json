    "body": "Is `flask run` supposed to spin up a TLS listener if the app is configured with TLS?\r\n\r\nTake this `app.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    app.run(ssl_context=('cert.pem', 'key.pem'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n- If i run `python app.py` i get the expected `Listening on https://...` and all is well - note the http**s**.\r\n- If i run `flask run` i get an HTTP listener, `Listening on http://...`. No TLS.\r\n\r\nIs this expected behaviour? May i suggest mentioning this somewhere in the quickstart? - http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/\r\n\r\nWould be great if someone would lay out the difference between the two invocations.\r\n\r\nRef:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/48518584/",
