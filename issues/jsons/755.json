    "body": "if the context is preserved for later inspection, it doesn't get popped off the stack immediately, but later, when the next context gets pushed. And when it does eventually get popped, the `teardown_appcontext` handler is called with no exception, instead of the one that was handled by the debugger. this is causing the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension to `commit()` the session even though the `rollback()` method should have been called instead.\n\n(see https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/issues/131 and https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/issues/115)\n\nthanks to @mgax for the further investigation of the issue\n",
