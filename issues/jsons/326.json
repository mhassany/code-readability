    "body": "Right now a test client can preserve the context for a little longer, so can exceptions. However there is no information if there is a context \"on hold\" on the stack which leads to the problem that if you continue to trigger exception you build up items on the stack in debug mode for nothing. There should always only be one context on the stack preserved and if another request comes in it should be removed.\n\nThis might also make the test client cleaner.\n"
