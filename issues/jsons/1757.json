    "body": "Is there a way to design blueprints to incorporate DELETE?\n\nI've been getting a error for a long time because I want to implement a form button action to just do a basic delete functionality for my app.\n\n```\nMethod Not Allowed\n\nThe method is not allowed for the requested URL.\n```\n\nThis is what my method looks like and nothing seems to be working...\n\n```\n@mod.route('/region/<region_id>', methods=['DELETE'])\ndef delete_region(region_id):\n```\n\nIt seems as if Flask only does GET and POST not DELETE or PUT... And my only alternative is to do GET based DELETE methods as an alternative workaround... this however when logging proves to be not the best way to display my data and how it is modified or accessed. Any advice here? Thanks a bunch.\n\nAlso, I'm not making an API ... I just want to make a link to delete one specific entry.\n\n```\nGET based DELETE\n\n@mod.route('/region/<region_id>/delete', methods=['GET'])\ndef delete_region(region_id):\n\n```\n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/flask/comments/2ax1mf/af_delete_example/\n",
