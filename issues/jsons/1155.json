I went searching to a list of previous versions on PyPI to see if this was removed at some point, but according to [this issue](https://bitbucket.org/pypa/pypi/issue/52/website-should-list-all-versions-of-a), the package maintainer must explicitly allow users to see previous versions, and this hasn't been done.\n\nGiven this information, it's probably best to remove the section on accessing the dev version without using Git from the documentation. If someone of authority agrees, I'd like to do this. :smile: \n"
