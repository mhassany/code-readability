SonarQube warned me about Cognitive Complexity. There is documentation here;\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/d4b688bd035b9704b3168b28fed39c8fcfe3b997/src/flask/debughelpers.py#L130\r\n\r\nthis part can be changed like that.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif reqctx and reqctx.request.blueprint is not None:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other thing is;\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/d4b688bd035b9704b3168b28fed39c8fcfe3b997/src/flask/debughelpers.py#L146-L150\r\n\r\nthis part can be changed like that.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndetail = \"no match\"\r\nif triple is not None:\r\n   detail = \"found (%r)\" % (triple[1] or \"<string>\")\r\n   total_found += 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think we can say; if the triple variable is **None**, don't run this `total_found += 1` statement.\r\n\r\nThe last one is;\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/d4b688bd035b9704b3168b28fed39c8fcfe3b997/src/flask/debughelpers.py#L154-L159\r\n\r\nI think this part can be changed too. Because `total_found` variable initialized with **0** value.\r\n\r\nSo, there will be two situations always. for **0** or for **> 1**.\r\n\r\nWhen `total_found` is 0 or 1, the `seems_fishy` will be True. So, we may don't need to reassign this variable for each control flow. Instead of that, we can change this code like below;\r\n\r\n```python\r\ninfo_msg = \"Error: the template could not be found.\"\r\nseems_fishy = True\r\nif total_found > 1:\r\n   info_msg = \"Warning: multiple loaders returned a match for the template.\"\r\n```\r\n**518 tests are passed and 14 skipped**.\r\n\r\nLink to any relevant issues or pull requests.\r\n\r\n#3254",
