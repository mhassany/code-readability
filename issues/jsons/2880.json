( https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1575#issuecomment-146516535) \r\n\r\nLooking through http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/ I cannot see any explanation in this regard. I also don't understand why the name of the app must be exported as environment variable and cannot simply be an argument to the flask command. Without an explanation that seems very cumbersome to me. And what is the recommendation on how to run a flask app not for local development?\r\n",
