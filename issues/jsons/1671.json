    "body": "Major discussion of the issue is in #248. \n\nI'm tired of working around it, so just like to get it fixed. \n\nThis solution is similar to #1402 & #1209 with a few changes:\n- I found it unexpected that in #1402 to convert a python list to a top level array you had to pass `jsonify(*l)`. I changed it so that both `jsonify(1,2,3)` and `jsonify([1,2,3])` serialize to `[1,2,3]` as I think that's the more intuitive behavior.\n- Per the discussion in #1209 & #248, I didn't create a separate config variable to modify this behavior. \n\nI know it'd be nice to incorporate a fix for #1443 in here as well, but I don't fully understand the issue there. So let's get this merged, and then tackle that issue in a followup PR.\n\nFix #170, #248, #510, #673, #1177 and check one of the boxes on #1182 \n",

            "body": "Agreed. \n\n`json.dumps()` only accepts the first item and appears to silently drop the others, so I considered copying that. It might be more natural as most people are used to the `dumps()` API. \n\nHowever, `jsonify()` currently accepts `**kwargs`, so I decided handling `*args` this way was more internally consistent.\n\nOverall, I think the divergence in accepted input between `json.dumps()` and `jsonify()` creates more confusion than convenience. Right now I sometimes forget which one supports `kwargs` and which supports arrays. And I'm not the only one who has [trouble remembering](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7907596/json-dumps-vs-flask-jsonify). \n\nSplitting behavior so `jsonify()` rejects `*args` but happily handles `**kwargs` just adds to the confusion, so we should pick either of the following:\n1. Make `jsonify()` internally consistent so it accepts both `*args` and `**kwargs`. \n2. Make `jsonify()` consistent with `dumps()`, meaning they both only accept a single argument. This implies a long term plan to deprecate  `jsonify(**kwargs)` so that it throws an exception just like `dumps(**kwargs)`.\n\nI don't care strongly, but if I had to pick I'd choose the latter because it's simpler to think of `jsonify()` as a `json.dumps()` that adds Flask niceties like the response class and serializing datetimes/UUIDs.\n"

That behavior is a bit more loose than `dumps()`, but I think it's more convenient for the user and unlikely to trip up anyone unexpectedly. If anything, copying `dumps(1,2,3)` by serializing `jsonify(1,2,3)` to `1` is more likely to trip up someone. \n\n> Shouldn't jsonify with both args and kwargs fail?\n\nStill a very valid question, but I don't want it to delay merging this PR. For now, let's just stick with Flask's current behavior which is to accept both `args` and `kwargs` and serialize them to a dict. We can discuss changing that behavior in a separate issue or PR.\n"

Other than relocating, I made minimal changes to existing tests.\n3. Expanded the docs for `jsonify()`. I'm not very familiar with RST/sphinx, so there might be some formatting issues I missed.\n4. Restructured the code handling the `*args`/`**kwargs` to be more explicit and linear. Previously, it wasn't always clear which combinations of `*args`/`**kwargs` would throw an exception and cause the `try`/`except` block to switch from dict to array.\n5. As part of this restructuring, made it so passing `args` + `kwargs` at the same time to `jsonify()` will fail as suggested by @ThiefMaster. After thinking about it more, I agree that this is the least surprising outcome rather than silently dropping either the `args` or `kwargs`.\n\nFeedback welcome. \n"
