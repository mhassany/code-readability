    "body": "Hello,\n\nI'm new to python and I'm just playing around Flask. \nPlease consider following application (I have simplified my application to just show the issue):\n\n``` Python\n@app.route('/thread', methods=['GET'])\ndef thre():\n\n    def run():\n        # Execute some external command. \n        # Note: I tried popen, call, etc...\n        os.system(\"sleep 10\")\n        print \"Done\"\n\n    # Execute the external command in a own process in order to return quickly\n    # Note: I tried Thread, start_thread, etc...\n    backProc = Process(target=run, args=())\n    backProc.start()        \n\n    # Create a generator/iterator. (Simplified)\n    def gen():\n        yield \"My Result\"\n        return\n\n    # Return the generator. \n    return Response(gen(),  status = 200, mimetype='text/plain')\n```\n\nIf I will now call the REST service with curl \n\n`curl localhost:5000/thread`\n\nthen I noticed that curl waits 10 seconds before it returns. It seem like that the \"os.system\" call blocks Flask of sending the data to the client. \n\nIf I use the same example without generator/iterator everything works as expected. The client receives the \"My Result\" before the \"os.system\" call finished.\n",
