    "body": "http://feedback.flask.pocoo.org/faq\n\n> While we cannot integrate that into Flask in the same way because we do not have any kind of user interface that could accomodate such a button, we however encourage users to send us little messages about their experience with Flask.\n\nThere is a way to give users a way to send feedback through Flask -- by making the feedback form part of Flask's API.\n\nMy original idea was to create a new module `flask.feedback` that would expose two functions called something like `is_good`/`is_bad` which would be imported from `flask.__init__`.\n\nSo the enduser can do the following:\n\n``` python\n\n>>> import flask\n>>> flask.is_good(\"I love me some Python 3 support.\")\nThanks!\n>>> flask.is_bad(\"lol it duznt werk\")\nNoted.\n```\n\nDuring an initial discussion in IRC, @rpicard also brought up the idea of exposing this through a CLI tool `flask-feedback`.\n\nI already looked into a possible implementation of this, by determining whether this could be cleanly implemented via the API that already exists for the form on the website. The form seems to contain some Javascript-based spam-protection though.\n\nWhile there are the options of 1.) creating a new API just for the integrated tool 2.) removing the protection, i am hesitant to do any more work, as such a feature built into Flask itself could be easily used to send massive amounts of spam, and there is little protection available against this.\n\nI'd just hope nobody brings up the dedication to modify the tool. While i didn't check it, i guess the javascript protection could be easily bypassed as well. Probably the goal of it is just to protect against bots that crawl arbitrary websites and send off forms, not the ones that target Flask's feedback website specifically.\n\nHowever, before any implementation i'd like some feedback on it.\n",
