    "body": "This updates the `Blueprint.route` decorator to support decorating `MethodView` classes.\r\n\r\nFixes Issue #3404.\r\n\r\n#### Comments\r\n+ I assume this will be part of the v2.0.0 release, so that's what I used for `versionchanged` and the changelog entry. If this is incorrect please let me know.\r\n+ I wasn't sure where to put the tests - the code changes are part of `blueprints.py` but really only effect `views`, so I put it in `view.py`.\r\n+ Let me know what other tests should be added.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nCommit checklist:\r\n\r\n* add tests that fail without the patch\r\n* ensure all tests pass with ``pytest``\r\n* add documentation to the relevant docstrings or pages\r\n* add ``versionadded`` or ``versionchanged`` directives to relevant docstrings\r\n* add a changelog entry if this patch changes code\r\n\r\nTests, coverage, and docs will be run automatically when you submit the pull\r\nrequest, but running them yourself can save time.\r\n-->\r\n"
