Other users can view `x`, `y` and the `/foo`, which contains data from both sections and some other things.\n\nIn most cases, I'd prefer `/something/x` and `/something/y`, but this is not the case, `x` and `y` are used in several parts of my app and really makes sense in this case.\n\nI just created a blueprint factory to fix this issue for me, using different names.
