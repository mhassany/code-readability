    "body": "Currently you can only declare error handler for Werkzeug exceptions. That's pretty much the case because what is not raised as a Werkzeug HTTP exception can't be catched. However since Python 2.4 is currently in the process of being phased out we could now finally make exceptions actual response objects if we prefer so it would make sense to keep that in mind and provide catching not only by code but also by any kind of instance check.\n\nThis also affects Werkzeug.\n\nRelated feedback issues:\n- http://feedback.flask.pocoo.org/message/112\n",
