    "body": "Hi,\n\nI just downloaded the sourcecode for the AJAX with jQuery example (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/patterns/jquery/). \n\nWhen i try and run index.html, it gives me an error: \"Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined\" for index.html:5.\nFor layout.html, it gives 2 errors:\n\"GET http://localhost/templates/script.js\" for layout.html:5\n\"Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token {\" for layout.html:7\n\nConsequently, the example doesn't work as no result is generated if you put 2 numbers in the input boxes.\n\nCheers\n",
