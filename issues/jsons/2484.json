    "body": "Prior to werkzeug 0.12.2, it was possible to manipulate the status code to exception type maps flask used by invoking\r\n\r\n    flask.abort.mapping.update(mapping)\r\n\r\nThis brings that back by creating a flask specific werkzeug.exceptions.Aborter object and exposing it as flask.aborter. It also implements a flask.abort function so that the correct docstring is exposed:\r\n\r\n    flask.aborter.mapping.update(mapping)\r\n\r\nI've included tests for the new feature which include 100% coverage of the new code branches, and all tests pass (in python 2.7).\r\n\r\nThis also helps address #2218 without having to lock to the specific version of werkzeug.",

You can always change the existing aborter the same way, it just lives in Werkzeug instead of Flask."
