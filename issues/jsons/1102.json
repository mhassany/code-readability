    "body": "In order to run a Flask application during development we have the `.run()` method or with 1.0 `flask run`. While both are convenient they are a bad idea.\n\nFirst of all their naming implies that, they are used for running a Flask application, they aren't. They are for running a Flask application during development, a subtle but important difference that causes significant confusion. Apart from that though, running a Flask application is never what you want.\n\nInstead you want to _develop_, _test_ or _deploy_ an application. While development and testing can imply running a web server, running a web server during development means something different than running a web server during testing. In deployment you don't actually want to run your application at all, you should let a web server do that.\n\nSo far we kind of allow people to signal their intent with DEBUG and TESTING, but this needs to be explicitly configured by every user and issues such as #1049, show that this is not without issues.\n\nTherefore what I would like to propose is to create three commands `develop`, `test` and `deploy`. These commands should be extendable through extensions and users. It should be easily possible to use different configurations for these scenarios.  Extensions that are only helpful during development like Flask-Debugtoolbar could activate/deactivate themselves based on intent, Flask-Migrate could perform migrations during development and extensions dealing with assets could start background threads monitoring the file system for changes during development. It would further simply clear up a lot of confusion for newcomers.\n\nRunning flask with either of these commands should by default set `DEVELOPMENT` (for backwards compatibilty also DEBUG but let's remove that, the name is awful), `TESTING` or `DEPLOYMENT` respectively and issue a signal. Furthermore `develop` should run the development server as `run` does now. `test` and `deployment` shouldn't actually test or deploy the application as we don't want to enforce a specific test runner or deployment solution. Instead the user should be implement these, if so desired. Nevertheless they would be useful as they establish convention extensions can rely on.\n\nI realize that such a change is probably somewhat controversial (which is why this is not a pull request), it would also distinguish us significantly from Django, which works like Flask does now. Nevertheless I think it would be a great idea and I'm curious what others think of this idea. So, thoughts?\n",

Not renaming preserves compatibility, but also gives us the opportunity to point people in the right direction in the form of the warning.\n\nThanks for Flask!\n"

            "body": "I'm strongly -1 on removing `app.run()`. True, some people use it on production, but what's going to prevent people from running `flask runserver` on production as well?\n\nI don't oppose having an alternative method of starting the application that eliminates the need to issue the `app.run()` altogether, but removing `app.run()` just like that seems wrong to me. Just add a warning to it, make it as scary as you want, but don't break a workflow that people have been using for ages. If you guys feel strongly about removing it, then do it properly, start by deprecating it (scary message) and wait 2-3 releases to actually remove it.\n\nAlso, having access to a method that starts the application is useful for certain kind of tests. An example is when you want to run tests with Selenium, where you need a real server running. See how I do it [here](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky/blob/579ecd9435b392df114110985f514ad173a315f2/tests/test_selenium.py#L48). Obviously this can be implemented differently if `app.run()` didn't exist, but I think it is convenient and super simple to do it this way.\n\nRegarding renaming `run()` to something else, I think it achieves little. At the end of the day, this is just a sequence of letters. Name it whatever you want, but you'll always have people that will find it way more easy to use that instead of gunicorn, uWSGI, etc.\n"
