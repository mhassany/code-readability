    "body": "If the test client could set debug=True, it would allow testing with assertions in view functions hit by the test client.\n\nWhen updating tests for pull request 336, I noticed the testing pattern of making assertions inside an inner view function -- while clever -- must be done carefully.  Because the test client does not set debug=True, the exceptions caused by the assertions were swallowed (which could have resulted in silently failing tests).  With debug=False in the test client, you have to verify the status code in the test client to ensure all assertions pass, which the test case now does.\nhttp://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/flask/testsuite/basic.py#L363\n\nHere's the pull request for reference:\nhttp://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/pull/336\n",

It's a documentation issue then, because (a) when I look at `test_client(...)` that option is listed elsewhere and (b) there's something about setting `testing=True` on `test_client(...)` that seems redundant.
