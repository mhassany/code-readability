For example, if the package is installed, the `.env` file might be in `/etc/myapp/config`, which probably isn't the right cwd either. Supervisor, uWSGI, and other runners have the ability to set the working dir if desired.\r\n\r\nBasically, if the user specifies a non-ancestor top dir, I'm assuming they will be the ones managing the working directory."

What I was thinking this would look like is something like this:\r\n\r\n    def load_dotenv(path=None):\r\n        # ...\r\n\r\nIf `path` is not passed, then you call `find_dotenv()` to locate the `.env` and/or `.flaskenv` files (not sure `top_dir` is worth the trouble). But then I can also do this:\r\n\r\n    load_dotenv(join(dirname(__file__), '.env')\r\n\r\nAnd this loads the .env directly from the place I know I have it. In this second option there would be no need to look for `.env` and `.flaskenv`, or to search parent directories, you will just go and load from the filename I give you, regardless of its name and/or location. For those developers that want to use `.env` just for development, they can just let Flask look for these files, and for those that want to also load an explicit .env file, they can do it in a way that feels a bit more integrated.\r\n\r\nAlso let's not forget that the `flask` command is sometimes also used in production. As an example, with the current changes, both Flask-Migrate and Flask-Alembic's commands would be used in production, and would be importing .env and .flaskenv files, while the main server running through gunicorn/uwsgi/etc. would not, and this seems like an inconsistency to me."

I'll push a rollback for most of the previous commit.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo give some context of how I would use this, here's what my project setup looks like in production:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/home/project/  # owned by \"project\" user\r\n    venv/  # added to path so it doesn't need to be activated\r\n    .flaskenv\r\n    uwsgi.ini\r\n    wsgi.py  # optional, usually not needed for my setups\r\n```\r\n\r\nA build of the project is installed with `pip install -U project.whl uwsgi`. uWSGI is run from a systemd unit, sets the user and working directory to \"project\". Units have a directive `EnvironmentFile`, so we don't even need to load the `.env` file with Python. Any runner can set the working directory, so even if it can't load an env file, calling `load_dotenv()` from a `wsgi.py` file will do the right thing at that point.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, for the `flask` command: SSH into the machine as the \"project\" user. You're already in the home directory containing the `.flaskenv` file, so run `flask db upgrade` and it's loaded as expected."
