Especially things like the app factory don't really need to be there (could go into an `app.py`); same for instances of extension classes (one file per extension keeps things clean if you ever need more code related to some extension, e.g. custom sqlalchemy naming schemes).\r\n\r\nI used to point people to https://github.com/GameSurge/web quite often when they were asking for suggestions how to structure their apps. The project in that repo is kind of unfinished but the structure works pretty well."

The users reading the tutorial are the ones most in need of seeing a well structured app with the factory and blueprints, but that adds a lot of up front explanation and boilerplate that looks confusing. It feels like I'm sacrificing the \"quick and easy to get started\" idea, which is one of Flask's selling points that brought in those new users.\r\n@davidism \r\n\r\nI think the quick start and a tutorial are two different things. The quick start is the minimal amount to start the app, i.e, writing a short app and running `flask run`. I think it makes sense for the tutorial to aim for people who want to learn how to structure their app correctly. In the tutorial case it makes sense to add more detail and isn't exactly a quick start. The 0.12 tutorial isn't really a quick start either. "

It may be a great pattern later on when building Flask apps but it seems quite complex and you don't really go into a lot of reasoning as to WHY its needed.  \r\n\r\nI am new to Flask but not Python and dealing with import errors when trying to modify the tutorial codebase to suit my own purposes had me wanting to pull my hair out. \r\n\r\nI think tutorials are best when they start simple and add things in layers.  You could have started with the sub-optimal way to do things by statically declaring the Flask object and then added examples showing the factory pattern. \r\n\r\nTo be honest, the tutorial has kind of given be a bad taste for Flask, and I'm considering moving to Django. :(  \r\n\r\nEdit:  Maybe adding more info about how the application factory works would help?  One thing that confuses me after going through the tutorial is what is actually calling the factory?  How does it get created and used?"

Therefore, I am assuming that most people are interested in a tutorial that demonstrates a database backed application.\r\n\r\nHowever, instead of using sqlite3 directly, I believe that the tutorial should be using flask-sqlalchemy. \r\nUsing flask-sqlalchemy is not more complex than using sqlite3 directly, however it will eliminate the next step of people searching for how to use sqlalchemy to connect to a non-sqlite database. In reality, people dont built sqlite backed application.. but instead using some kind of a relational db or mongo. \r\n\r\nIn fact, this is so important that the official tutorial has dedicated a section to showing how NOT to configure sqlalchemy (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/appfactories/#factories-extensions). Stackoverflow is full of people asking very basic questions on how to setup sqlalchemy in the right way.\r\n\r\nMy proposal results in no increase in complexity of the tutorial - the user today has to install sqlite3 anyways. It just uses the most popular library (which most people will try to use unsuccessfully anyway)."

            "body": "thank you for replying. I do think that it is already using an extension - sqlite3. I would not have suggested this, if the tutorial was one without any database implication. \r\n\r\nIf you look at it, there is already upfront complexity coming from teardown_appcontext (why do you need to close the database, etc). If you think about it, using flask-sqlalchemy will actually reduce the need to understand/worry about this (since it will attach teardowns inside the library itself).\r\n\r\nWith the happy consequence that, going forward, the learner continues to use this pattern with any other database they use. This is such a big issue that sqlalchemy clarifications are kind of present all over the documentation anyway.\r\n\r\nPlease do think about it. The reality is that your tutorial is good that it reflects real world usage (database). There is no harm down in reducing library complexity by using the most popular extension .. that people will end up using anyway! "
