Today when attempting to use the variable \"messages\" in my template I found the flashed messages are exposed there as a global in the templates.  That's probably ok but unless I missed it, this is not documented in the flash() documentation: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/api/#message-flashing or the jinja context here: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/templating/\n\nMy \"messages\" were hidden completely by the (empty) flash messages until I realized what might be happening.\n\nAnyhow, thanks for the great tools!\n",
