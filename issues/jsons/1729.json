In fact, it makes the IPython shell the privileged choice. The Python shell will be used if IPython is not available or the `--no-ipython` flag is passed.\n\nThe code is patterned on the similar feature available in `flask-script`: https://github.com/smurfix/flask-script/blob/d03cc660cf5a92e0bff367f982a872f7dd5bae07/flask_script/commands.py#L277-L312.
