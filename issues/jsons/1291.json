Enable 500 handlers on blueprint level\n\nand all this while without breaking compatibility in not-already-broken usecases (which rely on the logic flaws i fixed)\n\nTODO:\n1. bake this into some tests as well\n2. one error says\n   \n   > It is currently not possible to register a 500 internal server error on a per-blueprint level.\n   \n   why is this?\n",
