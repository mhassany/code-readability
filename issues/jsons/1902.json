If I get this working, I could file a PR.\n\nI moved flaskr.py into a new folder \"flaskr\" and created an empty __init__.py file. I then created the following setup.py file:\n\n```\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nsetup(\n        name='flaskr',\n        description='Simple microblog example using Flask',\n        packages=find_packages(),\n        entry_points='''\n                [flask.commands]\n                initdb=flaskr.flaskr:initdb_command\n        ''',\n)\n```\n\nIn a new conda environment, I installed the development version of flask and did a pip install of the flaskr folder containing the setup.py. Now when I run `flask initdb`, I get the following error.\n\n```\nUsage: flask initdb [OPTIONS]\n\nError: Failed to find application in module \"flaskr\".  Are you sure it contains a Flask application?  Maybe you wrapped it in a WSGI middleware or you are using a factory function. \n```\n\nAny hints on where to go next? I'm looking at the [docs](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/cli/#custom-commands), and it seems like this should work now.\n"

These steps:\n\n```\nexport FLASK_APP=flaskr\nexport FLASK_DEBUG=1\nflask run\n```\n\nWill never work because there is no way for Python to find the flaskr.py file. The fix we are using is:\n\n```\nexport PYTHONPATH=`pwd`\n```\n\nOr similar, and then of course the tutorial works. In the past the tutorial used to involve using python to run the flaskr.py file itself, not sure why this changed to the 'flask' binary but the change means people can't complete the tutorial...thereby damaging Flask's reputation!\n"
