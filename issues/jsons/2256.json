    "body": "* be explicit about how tuples are unpacked\r\n* allow `bytes` for status value\r\n* allow `Headers` for headers value\r\n* use `TypeError` instead of `ValueError`\r\n* errors are more descriptive\r\n* document that view must not return `None`\r\n* update documentation about return values\r\n* test more response types\r\n* test error messages\r\n\r\ncloses #1676\r\n\r\n`TypeError` is more correct by definition (wrong type to function), and I don't think anyone should be catching that error anyway (what would it mean to do that?), so I'm ok if this somehow breaks some code. This is also consistent with what `force_type` returns for bad input.\r\n\r\nI had to get a bit creative with displaying the error from `force_type` while injecting a new descriptive message. It would be nice if we could just use `raise new_error from original_error`, but that's Python 3 only.\r\n\r\nThese error messages will hopefully help avoid a class of questions that are frequently asked on Stack Overflow. In particular, there was no error about incorrect types that made it to `force_type`, so users trying to return JSON with something like `return True` would get a mysterious \"bool object is not callable\" error."
