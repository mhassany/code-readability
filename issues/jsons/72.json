This `send_file` is doing quite a bit more than what I understood was necessary for X-Sendfile.\n\nI am going to implement a nearly identical function called `nginx_send_file` to explore these issues further and see if I can provide a patch or a better suggestion (maybe a slick middleware that can support both features).\n\nBTW, great work on flask.
