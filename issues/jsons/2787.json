This helps with the 'UnsupportedOperation: not writable' error in Jupyter.\r\n\r\nI think that Jupyter hijacks and locks the STDOUT/STDERR (at least the one click is trying to use) and if you don't provide a stream to click.echo(), it will attempt writing to the STDOUT/STDERR, hence the error.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nCommit checklist:\r\n\r\n* add tests that fail without the patch\r\n* ensure all tests pass with ``pytest``\r\n* add documentation to the relevant docstrings or pages\r\n* add ``versionadded`` or ``versionchanged`` directives to relevant docstrings\r\n* add a changelog entry if this patch changes code\r\n\r\nTests, coverage, and docs will be run automatically when you submit the pull\r\nrequest, but running them yourself can save time.\r\n-->\r\n",

Typically, a ticket describing the issue in detail should be created first.\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not seem like an issue that should be fixed in Flask. It sounds like an issue with Jupyter or Click. This change bypasses everything Click does to ensure the output stream behaves consistently on different platforms."
