    "body": "The tutorial currently describes why escaping in Jinja is good, then proceeds to do `{{ entry.text|safe }}`. There's an explanation for this in the introduction, \"This HTML is not sanitized because we trust the user here.\" but that's not reiterated near the `safe` call, and isn't really a good pattern to teach in a tutorial anyway.\r\n\r\nMany users end up copying the `nl2br` filter from the [Jinja docs](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/api/#custom-filters) or [Flask snippet](http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/28/). I think it's a common and reasonable use case between \"trust user input\" and \"use markdown\". It would allow nicely formatted posts in the tutorial without sacrificing security.",
