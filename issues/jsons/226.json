Admin module is url_prefixed with '/admin' and everything is fine with it.\n\nThe only workaround I found was to add a /static route in frontend module and serve files manually.\n\nI've created a simple demo app to show the bug. It's available here: https://github.com/tomekwojcik/Flask-Module-Static-Files\n\nBest ragards.\n",
