Had to kind of piece them together, and then I had to deploy again and had forgotten the procedure. Writing it down helped a lot for me and I thought others might find it useful. Someone on the mailing list was into it, so I made the PR. But it makes a ton of sense not to tie ourselves to Dreamhost's procedures if they change. Would y'all be willing to link to this as an external resource somewhere that I host separately? I sent to DH but I don't expect a prompt response or anything."
