It's obviously possible to work around this, but ideally I'd like to avoid having to refactor all of my session handling or keeping Flask back to version 10.2.\n\nThe actual code that is broken looks like this (some irrelevant stuff stripped out):\n\n```\nclass CartSession(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        if KEY_CART not in session:\n            session[KEY_CART] = {}\n        self.data = session[KEY_CART]\n\n    @property\n    def items(self):\n        item_list = self.data.get(KEY_ITEMS, [])\n        return [CartItem.from_dict(i) for i in item_list]\n\n    def add_item(self, quantity, product, option):\n        if KEY_ITEMS not in self.data:\n            self.data[KEY_ITEMS] = []\n\n        # This appends a dict to the list\n        self.data[KEY_ITEMS].append(CartItem(quantity, product.id, option).to_dict())\n```\n"
