This means that it's importable as long as you're in the virtualenv, rather than needing to be at the root project directory.\r\n* `FLASK_APP` can refer to it by name instead of path (or path to `__init__.py`). (This is true in some cases for non-installed packages in the next release, but installing is still recommended.)\r\n* You can install entry points, which is especially helpful if you need to customize the CLI.\r\n* You can deploy like any other Python library, by creating a wheel and installing it. The dev environment now mirrors the prod environment. This also helps you separate your app behavior from your repository structure.\r\n*  In Python 2 especially, it avoids common \"everything at the top level\" relative import problems.\r\n* You can isolate your tests using tox.\r\n* It prepares you for better organization for larger projects.\r\n\r\nBasically, you get all the benefits of installing packages in general."
