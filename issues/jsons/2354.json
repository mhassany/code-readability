If the view containing the generator had modified the session, those changes were not visible.\r\n\r\nThis does not enable modifying the session in the generator, as the headers will have already been sent. (Possibly does not apply to server-side sessions, but you would still need to manually save the session in the generator.)\r\n\r\nCloses #1348."
