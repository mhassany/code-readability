            "body": "`APPLICATION_ROOT`, along with `SERVER_NAME`, is only used when generating URLs outside a request (such as generating external URLs for an email). It appears to still be working as expected.\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.config[\"SERVER_NAME\"] = \"example.com\"\r\napp.config[\"APPLICATION_ROOT\"] = \"/app\"\r\n\r\nwith app.app_context():\r\n    print(url_for(\"static\", filename=\"test.txt\", _external=True))\r\n    # http://example.com/app/static/test.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Gunicorn to serve a Flask app under a non-root path, you need to configure Gunicorn to set the WSGI `SCRIPT_NAME` correctly. One way to do this is to set the `SCRIPT_NAME` environment variable.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSCRIPT_NAME=/app gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:5000 -w 2 example:app\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the dev server, you can use `DispatcherMiddleware` to configure the `SCRIPT_NAME` in a similar way. You can also use this with Gunicorn, if you don't want Gunicorn to handle `SCRIPT_NAME` itself.\r\n\r\n`dev_app.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom werkzeug.exceptions import NotFound\r\nfrom werkzeug.wsgi import DispatcherMiddleware\r\nfrom myproject import app\r\n\r\napp.wsgi_app = DispatcherMiddlware(NotFound(), {\"/app\": app.wsgi_app})\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport FLASK_APP=dev_app.py\r\nexport FLASK_ENV=development\r\nflask run\r\n```"
