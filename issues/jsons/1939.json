However there are currently test cases testing this behavior and I did not want to introduce a breaking change in a pull request without prior discussion. Can someone who is familiar with the discussion fill me in why it is required that a POST request with an empty body fails?\n\nSpecifically I am refering to the following test cases:\n\n```\ntest_post_empty_json_wont_add_exception_to_response_if_no_debug\ntest_post_empty_json_adds_exception_to_response_content_in_debug\n```\n"
