    "body": "fixes #3358 \r\n\r\nDue to the way `send_file` works, passing a text mode file-like object, such as `io.StringIO` in Python 3, would respond with 200 OK and an empty file, while printing a traceback to the terminal. Even in Python 2, this only worked by accident, and would probably fail if given a `StringIO.StringIO` object with Unicode data that did not encode with the system encoding. It appears `send_file` was only intended to work with binary mode data.\r\n\r\nNow, if the object is an instance of `io.TextIOBase` it raises a `ValueError`. This doesn't help for file-like objects that don't use the `io` ABCs (including Python 2), but it should cover most cases."
