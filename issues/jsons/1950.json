I'm attempting to solve the issue of mistyped or improperly defined app paths reaching the **import** call for the flask app server. Given the way `cli.py` is currently structured, I can't find a bulletproof way to ensure only correct paths/module names reach the import. \n\nIf that's the case, I believe the best response is to simply catch the error and return something more descriptive than `ImportError: Import by filename is not supported.` for debugging purposes.\n",
