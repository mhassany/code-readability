    "body": "Hi, all. I have a feature request that I've been thinking about for a while. Some times I want to look at what is in the session cookie. Obviously one way to do that is by logging the cookie at various points in your server-side code. But some times I want to inspect the cookie outside of the application, directly from the browser. There are various ways of doing this ([1][1], [2][2], [3][3]). But it requires defining a snippet of code each time you want to do it. \r\n\r\nThat said this feature request is to add in a utility, perhaps a CLI tool that decode a session cookie, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ flask decode <cookie-from-browser>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would prevent users from needing to define this snippet each time, and provide an easy to use interface. I'm curious to hear what others think and if this is indeed a feature that the community thinks will be useful. \r\n\r\n[1]: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-secure-is-the-flask-user-session\r\n[2]: https://gist.github.com/babldev/502364a3f7c9bafaa6db\r\n[3]: https://www.google.com/search?q=flask+session+cookie+decode",
