This is basically #1446, but I have updated it and made it \"dumber\". \r\n\r\nNB: I know that the other PR is old and there doesn't seem to be much enthusiasm for it, but I do think this is useful to have to get a high level overview of application routes, especially if they are being generated programmatically. \r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ flask routes\r\napi.me                    GET              /api/users/me/\r\napi.users                 GET              /api/users/\r\n                          POST             /api/users/\r\n                          PUT, DELETE, GET /api/users/<pk>\r\napi.users_schema          GET              /api/users/schema/\r\nauth_blueprint.authorized GET              /login/authorized\r\nauth_blueprint.do_login   GET              /do-login\r\nauth_blueprint.login      GET              /login\r\nauth_blueprint.logout     GET              /logout\r\nauth_blueprint.lr_test    GET              /lr\r\nstatic                    GET              /static/<path:filename>\r\n```",
