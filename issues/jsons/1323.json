This only showed up when I was testing with the built-in HTTP server, which is arguably not the way people will deploy Flask in production.\n\nYou could have a backward compatibility flag, but leave it off by default. If people are expecting multiple slashes to be significant, they are likely(hopefully?) have a test for this uncommon behavior. You could raise an exception if routes are defined with multiple slashes. Consider this route:\n\n``` python\n@app.route('/<first>/<rest>')\n```\n\nWhat's supposed to happen here if `<first>` is empty? Flask does not route `/<first>/<rest>` with `//x`.\n\nI do not think implicit redirects are a good idea. I do think there could be an option here, which could be on by default.\n\nURLs like '/x/../index.html' do not redirect in Apache or Nginx. (BTW, Flask doesn't handle this correctly, and this is clearly defined behavior in RFC 3986.  In this case, most browsers normalize these URLs before sending, but curl, for example, doesn't, and therefore Flask or the underlying Python HTTP server must.)\n"
