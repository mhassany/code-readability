Still, you have to use the ProxyFix middleware for those `X-Forwarded-` headers to be applied to the request object in the app.\r\n\r\n@davidism the secure flag is still useful in 2018. Apps that run only on HTTPS have a rule that redirects any request on HTTP to the same URL on HTTPS, so they continue to accept HTTP requests. The browser will happily send your session cookie on a HTTP request if you don't make it secure. I don't disagree with your assessment, but the `secure` flag in the session cookie still makes sense to be set on HTTPS only apps."

If the answer is user facing websites/applications served over web (-> in most cases going through public wifis etc.), then I hope Flask would default to the more 'safe' option (with the ability to override it). \r\n\r\nIf I look back at myself starting, I'd expect the defaults to provide as much security as possible and if something wasn't working because I wasn't following the most secure pracitces, I would learn something new (and important), consider whether my use case really can break this. With the default being false, I'm thinking \"smarter people than me wrote it\" and it never comes into question. It would be really interesting to collect the data on how many publicly accessible flask based websites don't realize it and don't have the session cookie secure. It's not something you notice easily.\r\n\r\nPersonally I don't like to rely on dynamic behavior based on seemingly unrelated options like the all powerful debug mode, or in some cases unreliable `is_secure`. \r\n\r\n###### Somewhat unrelated fun fact: Until today I didn't realize that the session is only signed by the app key, I always thought everything in it was hashed with the key as a salt, meaning I could store secret-ish stuff in there."

From their perspective all that happens is they never receive the cookie. The vast majority of users are new, I guarantee that most users, past me included, would have a very hard time determining that they weren't receiving cookies because of this setting. See the related issue of Chrome not storing cookies for localhost in some circumstances for evidence of that.\r\n\r\nSecure-by-default is good, but I think the actual surface exposed by this is rather low compared to the issues it will cause during development. I'd rather people understand their system and security needs when they're deploying, and understand the configuration available to them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe default cookie is secure from tampering, not from inspection. If you want to store private data in the session, you need to use a different session implementation, either an encrypted cookie or server-side storage.
