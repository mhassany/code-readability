    "body": "[Revised after reading the code more carefully.]\n\nI'd like to use Flask sessions with a few tweaks:\n- json instead of pickle\n- sha256 or sha512 instead of sha1\n- expiration when the browser closes _or_ after an idle time limit, whichever comes first: save_cookie(session_expires=something, expires=None)\n- automatically updated last-request time, to support the idle time limit\n\nIn the absence of direct support of these features, I think I can accomplish them with a SecureCookie/Session subclass.  It looks like I can make Flask use my subclass by overriding Flask.open_session(), but since the existing method contains slightly more logic than simply instantiating a Session, I'm concerned that overriding it might introduce strange behavior with future versions of Flask\n\nWould you consider exposing an official means of using a custom Session/SecureCookie class?  Maybe even turning some of the above tweaks into Flask configuration options?\n",
