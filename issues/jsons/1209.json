It says \"object is not iterable\", even though your custom json encoder will turn it into an iterable in a moment.  This is because Flask is trying to make it into a dict before that can happen.\n\nThis patch fixes this case.  Also it allows you to return other legitimate singular json values such as integers and strings.  Hopefully this doesn't raise any security issues.  If it does, someone else may wish to handle this more carefully.\n",

This PR seems to enable that ability, while still protecting against top level json lists.\n\nWhether json lists are considered a vulnerability Flask should handle, whether a config value allows top level lists to be enabled/disabled, and which browsers have been patched or not all seem to be concerns that can be handled in a separate PR(s).\n\nThe ability to disable array security is not needed to solve the problem.
