Long lines can be broken over multiple lines by wrapping expressions in parentheses. These should be used in preference to using a backslash for line continuation.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if changes like these - prettifying - should be preceded by an issue. If so, feel free to close this pull requests and I will file an issue asap. Thanks!",
