    "body": "The python logging facility provides a getter for the base logger class, logging.getLoggerClass().  This allows the base class of the logging singleton to be extended multiple times without overriding previous calls to logging.setLoggerClass(),   In my case specifically I'm setting up a base logging facility via an extended Logger,  flask won't play nice with this because its DebugLogger is not extended from the class returned via getLoggerClass().  For a patched version of the create_logging function see https://gist.github.com/981450\n"
