You can of course explicitly set the mime type as well, but imo if a filename is explicitly passed in that should take precedence\n",

In that case you should use:\n\n``` python\nattachment_name = \"myattachment.xml\"\nmimetype = mimetypes.guess_type(attachment_name)\nsend_file(my_file,\n    mimetype=mimetype,\n    as_attachment=True\n    attachment_name=attachment_name)\n```\n\nor even better if you know the mimetypes you'll be using in advance you can use some partially applied function helpers like:\n\n``` python\nsend_xml_file = functools.partial(mimetype='text/xml', as_attachment=True)\n```\n\nThen you can always use that function and be certain it will carry the 'text/xml' mimetype and be sent as an attachment:\n\n``` python\nsend_xml_file(my_file, attachment_name=attachment_name)\n```\n\nHope this helps someone who runs into this in the future.\n"
