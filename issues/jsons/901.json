    "body": "Hi,\n\nThe documentation could be improved a bit. Chapter 10 \"Configuration Handling\" explains well ho to set the config. However, it doesn't explain how to retrieve values from the config in other files. I found the following solution:\n\n```\nfrom flask import current_app as app\n...\napp.config['MY_SETTINGS']\n```\n\nIt should be added to the docs.\n\nBest,\n\nLaszlo\n",
