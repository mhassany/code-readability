    "body": "I can't seem to find a good place to share enhancement proposals and I've not come across any similar idea, so I thought I'd just ask it here. Coding static \"/static\" URLs is not the recommended style and we should use `{{ url_for('static', filename='xyz.abc') }}` in templates. While this is a great way of keeping Flask simple and dynamic, it's also becoming quite a lot of characters there if we have more resources we'd like to link to. Hence, wouldn't it be a considerably comfortable alternative if we had short forms like `{{ u(\"static\", \"xyz.abc\") }}` or at least for the static files like this: `{{ s(\"xyz.abc\") }}` ?\r\nI know this reduces readability, but inside a `<link>`s href it's self-explanatory and still just an additional way of specifying resources in a shorter form.",
