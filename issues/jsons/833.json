This is because I was trying to use the following these two lines to get debug messages based on the quick start:\n\nif **name** == '**main**':\n    application.run(debug=True)\n\n... however this will not work with mod_wsgi, now I know.\n\nHereby, I suggest to improve the documentation by including this fact, and advise the use of the following instead:\n\napplication.debug = True\n\nThis will potentially save a lot of time for those users, and it is not an intrusive documentation addition either.\n",
