    "body": "Hi. \nI wrote a post about benchmarking some web frameworks and found a strange bug in Flask.\nRequests per seconds were very low and not above 600 req/s. @miguelgrinberg contacted me about it and first thought that the issue was on my side but he also experienced the same behaviour.\n\nHere is the Link to the Blogpost:\nhttps://medium.com/@tschundeee/express-vs-flask-vs-go-acc0879c2122\n\nSomething might be blocking requests in Flask or Werkzeug.\n\nI am willing to help towards inverstigation. \nCheers Bijan\n",
