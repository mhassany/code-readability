    "body": "i've spent a day on this, and can't find any documentation for why this is happening, but it appears Flask does some kind of sanitation of headers if they are used inside `before_request`\r\n\r\nwhenever i try to extract token from 'Bearer xxxxxx' it makes the entire header disappear. regardless if doing string.split(' ') or substring. \r\n\r\nall of this works just fine in controllers. but i am trying to make it generic for all controller actions. so i don't want to decorate every endpoint. \r\n\r\nthe `Authorization` header looks like this `Bearer xxxxxxxxx`. but i also tested this on other custom headers and same thing happens. \r\n\r\n```\r\nbp = Blueprint('default', __name__)  # type: Blueprint\r\n\r\ndef create_app() -> Flask:\r\n    app = Flask(__name__)\r\n    add_request_authorization(bp)  # i tried this with app and bp\r\n    app.register_blueprint(bp)\r\n    return app\r\n\r\ndef add_request_authorization(bp):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    register okta verification event\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    @bp.before_request\r\n    def verify_okta_for_request(*args, **kwargs):\r\n        auth_header = request.headers.get('Authorization')  # this is ok\r\n        print('auth:', auth_header)   # prints\r\n        token = auth_header.split(' ')[1]  # makes the whole header \"None\" including on lines above\r\n        token = auth_header[7:]  # makes the whole header 'None\" \r\n```\r\n\r\nlooks like even if i try to assign the raw header to another variable, it vanishes! \r\n\r\ni also tried before_app_request",
