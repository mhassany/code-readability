    "body": "I think the changes introduced in https://github.com/pallets/flask/commit/fa6eded6f572dd4bc23b030f025156cdd1e63305 that swallow ALL exceptions if loading a custom CLI command fails are not good for the general development flow. I often do `flask --help` to see whether my custom command comes up fine and when it doesn't I don't get exceptions and I don't really know what I've done wrong.\r\n\r\nI think this `try-except` should be removed. I really think the CLI _should_ fail loudly instead of ignoring errors. Let's discuss this and if you guys agree I'll make a PR.",
