            "body": "- PEP8 actually discourages using `is` (or `==`) for boolean checks; these operators are only useful there if you really need to check the type as well. But FWIW, I think that if in this particular place we really care if it's literal False/True (ie if it could be None as well), using `is` is nicer even though it's not what PEP8 recommends ;)\r\n- Your rename from `d` to `data` results in mis-indented continuation lines. Also, I think there is absolutely nothing wrong with using short names in unit tests, especially if their purpose is obvious.\r\n\r\nWhile probably having good intentions, PRs like this not are not very helpful - they mostly add noise and this kind of refactoring is usually done in one go by one of the developers."
