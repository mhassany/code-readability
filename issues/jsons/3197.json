I really hate the default Python shell, because there is no tab completion and the first thing I do is to install IPython and use that.",

However, I don't want to add specific shells as built-in because it's not something I want to maintain as those shells change, or continue to add to the list.\r\n\r\nI think previously when this came up we discussed adding a hook for packages to add `--ipython` like options rather than whole commands, but I think we decided not to do that.\r\n\r\nI'd be open to a better default configuration that enables completion. I think Ned Batchelder has a blog about that which might be useful."
