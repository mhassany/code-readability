    "body": "Sometimes I want to use send_from_directory with special cases like pre-processing some file extensions or adding directory indexes. To access the relevant file myself, I need its filename. safe_join returns this name without sending the file directly.\n\nI could just copy 6 lines from Flask, but this part is the one that is easy to get wrong (and accidentally expose /etc/passwd ...)\n\nThe new function appears nicely in the API docs, tests pass, but I did not add any test. Should we unit test it individually or are tests that use send_from_directory enough?\n",
