            "body": "Does `add_command` replace an existing command?\n\nIn any case, I wonder if it'd make sense to extract [this code block](https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/c73cf0f82ef011ac4dbaf00ce4e8318fb9fb53dc/flask/cli.py#L426-L435) into a function a plugin can just import. While I don't consider `PYTHONSTARTUP` that important (IPython probably provides its own thing) it would provide some consistency if all shell implementations were using the exact same context.\n\nA `load_plugin_commands` setting would be useful too; similar to `add_default_commands`. In a bigger application where I provide my own shell commands etc I _really_ wouldn't want any package whose main purpose might not even be providing a shell to override one of my commands.\n\nFrom what It looks like, custom commands defined in the application code can be overridden by plugin commands. I haven't tested that and it's quite late here but if that's indeed the case I'd actually consider it a bug.\n"
