    "body": "I have an app with two blueprints - `admin` and `default`. Both are stored in separate packages - `app.modules.admin` and `app.modules.default`. Both have separate `templates` and `static` folders. `default` is registered first (w/o `url_prefix`), `admin` is registered second (with `url_prefix='admin'`). Now, when rendering a template in an `admin` view function Flask searches for the file first in `default/templates` and then in `admin/templates`, so if I have file `home/index.html` in both blueprints (which is my case) Flask loads the file from first registered blueprint (`default` in my case), totally ignoring paths. The same goes for templates loaded with `extends` statement.\n",

            "body": "I think this is by design?  My interpretation of the code is that the templates folders just get added to a search path, so then if you have `home/index.html` in both blueprints, then whichever blueprint got registered first wins.  The recommended workaround is to have `admin/templates/admin/home/index.html` and `default/templates/default/home/index.html` and reference `admin/home/index.html` or `default/home/index.html`. \n\nWhat I think would be an interesting change would be a different template search path for each blueprint, having it's the equivalent of . first, instead of wherever it is in the global flask path, allowing `home/index.html` to always match in the blueprint referenced.  Hmm...\n"
