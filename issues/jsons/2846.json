Provide\r\nany any extra information that may be useful / related to your problem.\r\nIdeally, create an [MCVE](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve), which helps us\r\nunderstand the problem and helps check that it is not caused by something in\r\nyour code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nCreate a file called frozenAccount.py to import the file and call the same name function defined in the file.\r\n\r\nAttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute'frozenAccount'.\r\n\r\nReplace the file name with others, and the program can be executed normally. So why can't this name be?\r\n\r\nOr because it's a reserved word\uff1f\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nTell us what happens instead.\r\n\r\n```pytb\r\nPaste the full traceback if there was an exception.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version:2.7.13\r\n* Flask version:0.12.2\r\n* Werkzeug version:0.14.1\r\n",
