            "body": "My vote is to remove them because I don't think they're relevant to anyone reading the current version of the docs. Flask 0.9 was released nearly four years ago, so very unlikely to be used by anyone for new projects. \n\nAnyone who needs them for legacy projects can still dig them up by pulling up the old versions of the docs. There's been a number of changes in the docs since 0.9, so legacy projects will still need to pull up those old versions anyway.\n\nI agree with @ThiefMaster that commented out stuff is just noise, so if the decision is that they're important enough to keep them, than I'd say that means they're important enough to not hide them from the docs at all. Perhaps tweaking the theme to make version-changed tags less noticable. For example, the SQLAlchemy docs went the route of preserving old version-changed tags, but their theme does an excellent job of making the version-changed tags blend right in when my eyes are skimming the page: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/sqlelement.html\n"
