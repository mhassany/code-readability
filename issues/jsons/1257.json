    "body": "Calling `flask.redirect()` or returning data from a callback passed to `Blueprint#before_app_request()` are ignored, despite the callback executing.\n\n`Flask#before_request()` and `Blueprint#before_request()` both appear to work as intended, redirecting and/or handling the request as appropriate.\n\nIt's not immediately clear from reading the inline documentation that this particular behavior is intended.  The only documentation I can find on the matter is on `Flask#preprocess_request()`, which doesn't really touch on Blueprint behavior:\n\n```\n    \"\"\"Called before the actual request dispatching and will\n    call every as :meth:`before_request` decorated function.\n    If any of these function returns a value it's handled as\n    if it was the return value from the view and further\n    request handling is stopped.\n\n    This also triggers the :meth:`url_value_processor` functions before\n    the actual :meth:`before_request` functions are called.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nIs this a bug or just an undocumented / intended behavior?\n",
