This is the smallest change I can see which supports the use case of building URLs for external apps.\n\nAlternatives:\n1. Have helpers.url_for call Flask.url_for on current_app.\n2. Hook into Flask.url_adapter, which would require subclassing of werkzeug.routing.Map to provide the Flask url_for logic.\n3. Register an error handler through the current Flask.register_error_handler, which would not support returning values without an effective GOTO statement.\n"
