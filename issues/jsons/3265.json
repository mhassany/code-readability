Sometimes the route can be visited twice in a row and the receipt is printed immediately. I can consistently get this working if I have 2.2.0 of python-escpos installed. However when I install the latest version I start experiencing these delays. I require the latest version to take advantaged of image printing and text formatting.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: 3.6.8\r\n* Flask version: 1.0.2\r\n* Werkzeug version: 3.6.8\r\n",
