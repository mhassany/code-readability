It's a bit inconvenient! So I add a some codes to the app.py file to render the url.\r\n\r\n```\r\n * Restarting with stat\r\n * You can visit http://localhost:5000/\r\n * Debugger is active!\r\n * Debugger pin code: 294-762-868\r\n * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\r\n```\r\n\r\n In my opinion, it's convenient than before. \r\n\r\nThanks you very much!\r\n",
