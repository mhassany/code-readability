    "body": "Error page is fine, but it could be better.\n\nFor example see this: http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=cs&sl=cs&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fdoc.nette.org%2Fcs%2Fdebugging (I am sorry, the page doesn't have an English version, but I think the point is understandable via Google Translator)\n\nExample is here: http://examples.nette.org/ndebug/nette-exception.html\nPHP code: https://github.com/nette/nette/tree/master/Nette/Diagnostics\n\nMoreover, it's plain HTML/JavaScript page, so framework can log right these into some defined place. It's very handy to run app on production -- when something fails, you can go to your log directory and see exactly what happened in the same way as it happened on your development server at localhost. You just open the saved HTML page with exception described and you can clearly see what happened. Of course, now you can e-mail the exceptions, but this dynamic plain HTML is so much more handy :-) E-mails are more like an alert, but they don't help much, even if they contain whole traceback.\n\nI don't say we should have exactly this in Flask, I want to just suggest we could improve the page, we could learn something.\n",
