    "body": "IMO, you would normally interpret \"creating and closing database connections all the time\" as \"creating and closing database connection on each request\" as opposed to keeping persistent database connection for a lifetime of an application. However, the documentation is either misleading or \"creating and closing database connection on each query\" was implied. This, and the term \"**application** context\" itself makes it look like data placed into flask.g will be available for the following requests, which is not true at all. Let's make the documentation more explicit on this.",
