For example, Django (github.com/django) and Rails (github.com/rails) have done this.

It is Armin's project so if other administrators or collaborators were desired by him, he would add them. Likewise, if they felt they needed help, I'm sure they could ask him and he'd be happy to add who they feel would fit the role.\n\n> Also, by creating a collection of repositories specific to Flask, it makes it easier to find \"official\" repos _[snip]_ This might be something to consider for approved extensions to require the master repo to be part of the Flask organization\n\nI understand very well why you would think this is a good idea, but I don't think every author of an approved extension would be willing to house their repository there. I'm sure some (if not most) would be fine with (if not honored by) it.\n\nHonestly speaking, that model is already **sort of** used by [requests](https;//github.com/requests) but only for authentication schemes and translations of documentation. Note, however, that @kennethreitz (also a contributor [read: maintainer] here) rightfully feels that the actual requests repository should stay on his account and that's wholly his decision. Sure @kennethreitz may have more time than Armin at the moment, but that really shouldn't be your main argument for moving the repository.\n\n@sfermigier your link doesn't work, but I think I know what you're talking about -- the [core](https://github.com/core) projects. I would love to help out with that too and see it followed through on. I'd even be willing to contribute/donate my [uritemplate](https://github.com/sigmavirus24/uritemplate) work to the project (as part of uricore if necessary).\n"

I chatted with him on irc probably 6 months ago and he mentioned he considered moving Flask to an organization but chose not to because of all the broken links/git remotes/etc.  Now that this seems to be resolved on Github's end, I thought it might be worth bringing up, but only Armin can make that decision (I understand why Kenneth would want to keep it under his own).  Open source work is both about giving back to the community, making available your hard work so others can build upon it, but it is also kind of an organic resume, showing off your work.  Just as an organization makes it easier to find other related projects, having a repo under your user account makes it easier to find other things you've done (and may get some followers from it).\n\nI'm currently the Flask-Script maintainer, but would definitely move the project to the new organization if it is created.  I have some major changes in it (reworked manager using argparse, support autocompletion using argcomplete, etc), but haven't found time to update the docs before a 1.0.0 release.\n"
