    "body": "This requires some explanation because it's potentially a controversial change.  We used to have `flask --app foo` support but this pull request essentially removes it.\n\nWhy are we doing this? Turns out there is a fundamental problem with how Click currently handles certain aspects and the feature that made `--app` work will have to change in Click. As a direct result of this we have to temporarily pretend we never had an intention to make that flag work.  I understand it's not a nice thing to do but I think in the grand scheme of things this is a good way to get a release out which is really something that needs to happen.\n\nI might want to bring this back later but this will require some major changes in Click which I rather not do at the same time as a Flask release.\n\nIn the process of this I also intentionally underdocument some APIs which I'm not super happy about. This should encourage people to not go all in with the cli for now.\n\nThe tracking issue for that is https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/590\n"
