Currently, if one of more blueprints does not use a url_prefix, all of their static files must be mashed together in the application static folder which is counterproductive for blueprint isolation.\n\nAdding a dummy url_prefix to get around this issue is not desirable either. Also @mattsmalley's solution only works if there is only one blueprint operating without a url_prefix.\n\n@artnez  What did you set the static_url_path to? I've tried '/myblueprint/static' and a variety of similar constructions, but url_for('myblueprint.static', filename='test.js') causes a BuildError. Couldn't find any docs on static_url_path and that static_url_path does not make http://localhost:5000/myblueprint/static/test.js available as expected.\n"

            "body": "Something very strange is up when using `static_url_path`, and I'm not using blueprints.  When I set:\n\n`app = Flask(__name__, static_url_path=\"\", static_folder=\"../public\")`\n\nthen `@app.route(\"/<path:path>\")` doesn't match on anything even though all my other routes work.  When I set:\n\n`app = Flask(__name__, static_folder=\"../public\")`\n\nthen `@app.route(\"/<path:path>\")` matches on everything including intercepting all links to resources in index.html, which is annoying.  It seems my only hope is to rebuild :tired_face: to default Flask locations (`<app>/static`) and see if that magically works.  I dislike magic.  Flask 0.10.1.\n\n##### Update\n\nOkay, after beating this up for several more hours, and no thanks to the docs or examples scattered about the net, I think I partly understand this now -- and I don't have to move my files :fireworks:.\n\nI had to turn my index.html into a template to see what path Flask would generate with `url_for('static', filename='bundle.js')`.  Turns out it was `/public/bundle.js`.  This was not obvious to me since I have a `run.py` and `app/__init__.py` setup, and `public` is at the same level as `app`.  Thus, I had two options with index.html:\n- Template it\n- Hard code `\"/public/...\"` into all the addresses\n\nI chose to hard code it (it's a React app and templating would be overkill... and anti-React).  I also found what does and does not work with `static_url_path` in these cases:\n\n> Works:\n\n```\napp = Flask(__name__, static_url_path=\"/public\", static_folder=\"../public\")\napp = Flask(__name__, static_folder=\"../public\")\n```\n\n> Works (for when I had index.html as a template in `public`):\n\n```\napp = Flask(__name__, static_url_path=\"/public\", static_folder=\"../public\", template_folder=\"../public\")\napp = Flask(__name__, static_folder=\"../public\", template_folder=\"../public\")\n```\n\n> Partially works (until you need to catch `@app.route(\"/<path:path>\")` for react-router page refreshes -- or something else weird):\n\n```\napp = Flask(__name__, static_url_path=\"\", static_folder=\"../public\")\n```\n\n> Does not work (of course):\n\n```\napp = Flask(__name__, static_url_path=\"/oops\", static_folder=\"../public\")\n```\n\nSo basically, `static_url_path` seems to be less of a setting and more of an acknowledgement of \"Okay, I understand what it is going to get set to if I leave it off when I set static_folder; so, I may I be admitted to the playground now?\"\n\nLesson learned: Stay away from `static_url_path=\"\"` :exclamation:\n\nThat might apply to this issue #521 as well.  Anyway, don't know how this may or may not apply to Blueprints but, there it is.  Perhaps this will be useful to someone headed down the same path or for writing better examples and docs.\n"
