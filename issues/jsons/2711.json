    "body": "A couple of minor fixes for the extensible session serializer added by #2352.\r\n\r\nThere were two issues observed:\r\n\r\n1. The example usage of ``register()`` passes and ``index`` to the ``force`` argument.\r\n2. It is not possible to insert a tag as the penultimate item in the order list.\r\n\r\nRegarding the latter, `a.append(x)` is not the same as `a.insert(-1, x)` - it is `a.insert(len(a), x)`.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to get these out before the release of 1.0.0 so that the index default is correct.\r\n\r\n- [x] add tests that fail without the patch\r\n- [x] ensure all tests pass with ``pytest``\r\n- [x] add documentation to the relevant docstrings or pages\r\n- [ ] ~~add ``versionadded`` or ``versionchanged`` directives to relevant docstrings~~\r\n- [ ] ~~add a changelog entry if this patch changes code~~ *Not required as the feature is unreleased?*\r\n",
