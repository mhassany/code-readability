    "body": "I am using Flask-paginate for pagination in my app. The results are fetched from database. The problem is that all results show up on 1st page and when I click on the next page number again all results are displayed on that page. The page number in url changes to 2/3/4 etc. I [this](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-paginate/) as reference. Here is my code snippet\n\n```\nfrom flask.ext.paginate import Pagination\n    @app.route('/users')\n    def users_page():\n\n        page_size = 25\n        limit = 100\n\n        search = False\n        q = request.args.get('q')\n        if q:\n            search = True\n        try:\n            page = int(request.args.get('page', 1))\n        except ValueError:\n            page = 1\n        with session_scope() as session:\n            users = users_dao.get_users(session, limit=limit)\n            pagination = Pagination(page=page, total=len(users), per_page=page_size, search=search, record_name='users')\n            return render_template(\"users.html\", users=users, pagination=pagination)\n```\n\nThe pagination info on html page says `displaying 1-25 results of 100`. When clicked on page 2, it says `displaying 25-50 results of 100`. So somehow the pagination has figured out on the basis of total and per_page how many results should be displayed but somewhere it fails to force that on number of rows to show.\n\nThe template looks like \n\n```\n{{ pagination.info }}\n    <table class=\"table\">\n        <thead>\n            <tr>\n                <th>User Name</th>\n                <th>Phone</th>\n                <th>City</th>\n                <th>Country</th>\n            </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n            {% for user in users %}\n            <tr>\n                <td>{{ user.user_name }}</td>\n                <td>{{ user.phone_number }}</td>\n                <td>{{user.city}}</td>\n                <td>{{user.country}}</td>\n            </tr>\n            {% endfor %}\n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n    {{ pagination.links }}\n```\n",
