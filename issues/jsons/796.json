The requirements.txt file is requesting flask 0.9, but whenever I try to install that version, I end up having 0.10.\n\nSo I'm assuming that the difference between their environment and mine is that version number (since that error is related to flask). So are there new features in 0.10 that break apps developed for 0.9? And how can I install 0.9? It looks like the 0.9 branch is missing in the repo.\n",
