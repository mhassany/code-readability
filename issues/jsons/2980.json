    "body": "I am running flask dev server using the `flask` command. If an exception is thrown (such as syntax error) and then fixed. The next reload fails with some sort of issues having to due with attempting to reinitialize extensions. For example I get the following error from flask-admin (though depending on order of imports I get similar errors from other extensions):\r\n```\r\nAssertionError: A name collision occurred between blueprints <flask.blueprints.Blueprint object at 0x1118b96d8> and <flask.blueprints.Blueprint object at 0x1042880b8>. Both share the same name \"admin\". Blueprints that are created on the fly need unique names.\r\n```\r\nI don't think this is the same issue as https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2423 as I can trigger the problem with non syntax error (ie a name error a module scope).\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version:\r\n`3.7`\r\n\r\n* Flask version:\r\n`flask==1.0.2`\r\n\r\n* Werkzeug version:\r\n`werkzeug==0.14.1`\r\n\r\n",
