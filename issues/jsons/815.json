    "body": "I've seen that people often write `@app.route(..., methods=[\"POST\"])`  as `@app.route(..., methods=\"POST\")`, which won't error immediately, but return a `405` status code later.\n\nWhich is very unfortunate, as people might think the methods parameter is a space or comma separated string with methods. Sometimes i write that myself because i still don't memorize that this part of Flask's API is actually that \"heavy\" on the syntax.\n\nSo what i propose is to add the following normalization code in `Flask.add_url_rule`:\n\n``` python\nif isinstance(methods, str):\n    if ',' in methods:\n        methods = methods.split(',')\n    elif ' ' in methods:\n        methods = methods.split(' ')\n    else:\n        methods = (methods,)\n```\n",
