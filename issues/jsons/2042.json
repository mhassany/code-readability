    "body": "What I am trying to achieve is pretty simple.\n\nI want to use Flask to create a web app that connects to a remote Server via API calls (specifically ParseServer).\nI am using a third-party library to achieve this and everything works perfectly when I am running my code in a stand-alone script. But when I add my code into the Flask I suddenly can't authenticate with the Server.\n\nIt seems to me that in Flask, the registration method used by the APi library is not remembered.\n\nI tried many things of putting the registration and initialization code in different places in Flask, nothing worked. \n\nI asked a similar question in the Github of the [Library](https://github.com/milesrichardson/ParsePy/issues/147) with no help. \n\nSo I guess I have **two questions** that could help me solve this:\n1) Where should I put a registration method and import of the files from this library?\n&\n2) What can I do to identify the issue specifically, eg. to know precisely what's wrong?\n\nHere's some code\n\nThe Flask code is here\n\n```\n@app.route('/parseinsert')\ndef run_parse_db_insert():\n    \"\"\"The method for testing implementation and design of the Parse Db\n    \"\"\"\n    pc = ParseCommunication()\n    print(pc.get_all_names_rating_table())\n    return 'done'\n\n```\n\nThe ParseCommunication is my Class that deals with Parse. If I run ParseCommunication from that script, with the same code as above in the **main** part, everything works perfectly.\n\nI run the Flask app with dev_appserver.py from Google App Engine.\n\nMy folder structure \n/parseTest\n  /aplication\n    views.py\n  app.yaml\n  run.py\n\nMy run.py code\n\n```\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nsys.path.insert(1, os.path.join(os.path.abspath('.'), 'lib'))\nsys.path.insert(1, os.path.join(os.path.abspath('.'), 'application'))\n\nimport aplication\n```\n",
