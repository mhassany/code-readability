    "body": "It would be nice if `test_client()` would accept default environ dictionary. That would stop us doing hacks like [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15278285/setting-mocking-request-headers-for-flask-app-unit-test) over and over.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\ntest_client = app.test_client(defailt_environ = {\n    \"REMOTE_ADDR\": \"127.0.0.1\"\n})\n```\n\n`default_environ` should be then passed down all the way to `environment_base` args of `EnvironBuilder` in test.py.\n\nThank you!\n",
