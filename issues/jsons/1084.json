It says on your site, \"Something that is untested is broken.\"  \n\nThe Issue I am raising is that a heavily used method render_template() does not appear to be fully testable in a direct sort of manner, and could use more documentation.\n\nIt is a little strange that I need to use get() to test render_template().  This leads to implicit rather than explicit testing of render_template().  If I use get() and discover that something isn't showing up, then I'm probably not using `render_template()` correctly or my `template` doesn't display the data correctly or I may have a `database` error.  \n\nI can write tests that check the database call and eliminate it as the source of the error.  Why can't I do the same with render_template(), and narrow it down to the template itself?\n\nI'm assuming that this is possible, but undocumented.  Thus my request that it be documented.\n\nThis raises another question: Can I test whether the render_template is providing the template with the correct parameters? e.g. The template expects a variable 'dog', but render template provides 'octopus'.  Is there an automated way to test this?\n"
