I deploy the simple demo on my server, and then use 'export FLASK_APP=demo.py' , 'flask run --host=0.0.0.0' to launch the program. \r\nHowever, I have tried every possible way to visit my web page, but failed all the same. It shows `time out`. I'm waiting sincerely for your help!!\r\n\r\n### My code:\r\n ```\r\nfrom flask import Flask\r\n app = Flask(__name__)\r\n \r\n@app.route('/')\r\ndef hello_world():\r\n    return 'Hello, World!'\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    app.run( host='0.0.0.0',port=5000)\r\n```\r\n### Note:\r\n1. I am sure there firewall(iptables) is closed on my server.\r\n2. I used Chrome to visit the web page, and got the result `time out`.\r\n",
