    "body": "The example in the docs under _Application Dispatching > Combining Applications_ is incorrect:\n\n```\nfrom werkzeug.wsgi import DispatcherMiddleware\nfrom frontend_app import application as frontend\nfrom backend_app import application as backend\n\napplication = DispatcherMiddleware(frontend, {\n    '/backend':     backend\n})\n```\n\nIt leaves you with nothing to run, because `application` is _not_ an application (and thus cannot be `run()`) but an instance of `DispatcherMiddleware`, which nothing can be done with whatsoever. Google had no mention of DispatcherMiddleware apart from the above page and the Werkzeug web site. You therefore try to run it as a Werkzeug application, but:\n- The Werkzeug documentation is lame and no help at all;\n- It is not the right approach anyway.\n\nThe code sample should either be:\n\n```\nfrom werkzeug.wsgi import DispatcherMiddleware\nfrom frontend_app import application as frontend\nfrom backend_app import application as backend\n\nfrontend.wsgi_app = DispatcherMiddleware(frontend.wsgi_app, {\n    '/backend':     backend\n})\n\nfrontend.run()\n```\n\nor:\n\n```\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom werkzeug.wsgi import DispatcherMiddleware\nfrom frontend_app import application as frontend\nfrom backend_app import application as backend\n\napplication = Flask(__name__)\n\napplication.wsgi_app = DispatcherMiddleware(frontend, {\n    '/backend':     backend\n})\n\napplication.run()\n```\n\nThere is one hint of this in _Quickstart > Hooking in WSGI Middlewares_ and another in the API reference for the `Flask` class, but neither of them is returned in Google searches about _Flask Werkzeug middleware_ for example.\n",

It works, it matches the example given in http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/#hooking-in-wsgi-middlewares, and it doesn\u2019t require creating another application, since it uses an existing one. Moreover, it emphasises the fact that the returned object is a WSGI appliction and not a Flask application. Therefore I suggest the documentation to be updated in accordance.\n"
