    "body": "Using TCP/5000 as the default port for flask may be a bad choice. I just had to debug a problem where I wasn't able to reach my service from outside of my network because the firewall (and I assume many firewalls do this) blocks incoming requests on port 5000.\r\n\r\nThis port is used for universal plug-and-play (UPNP) and it's considered a security problem if it's reachable from the internet says [source1](http://www.linklogger.com/TCP5000.htm) and [source2](https://www.grc.com/port_5000.htm).\r\n\r\nI therefore suggest to change the default port or mention this possible problem in the [documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/dev/quickstart/#public-server) so others don't have to search for this problem as long as I did.",
