    "body": "Python can be compiled without certain modules, including `ssl`. It's somewhat common for that to happen when users compile Python from source and don't have the `libssl` headers set up. `flask.cli` imports `ssl` unconditionally, but it's only for optional SSL cert support in the dev server, so this can be guarded with `except ImportErrror`. Werkzeug already has such a workaround, although it's a little more complicated than what needs to be done in Flask.\r\n\r\nIf no `ssl` module is imported, using the cert-related options in the CLI should raise a usage error.",
