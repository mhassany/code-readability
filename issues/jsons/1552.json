    "body": "As part of my PhD research on code authorship, we calculated the Truck Factor (TF) of some popular GitHub repositories.\n\nAs you probably know, the [Truck (or Bus) Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) designates the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or quit) before a project is incapacitated. In our work, we consider that a system is in trouble if more than 50% of its files become orphan (i.e., without a main author).\n\nMore details on our work in this preprint: https://peerj.com/preprints/1233\n\nWe calculated the TF for **Flask** and obtained a value of **1**.\n\nThe developer responsible for this TF is:\n\nArmin Ronacher - author of 90% of the files \n\nTo validate our results, we would like to ask **Flask** developers the following three brief questions:\n\n(a) Do you agree that the listed developer is the main developer of **Flask**?\n\n(b) Do you agree that **Flask** will be in trouble if the listed developer leave the project (e.g., if he wins in the lottery, to be less morbid)?\n\n(c) Does **Flask** have some characteristics that would attenuate the loss of the listed developer (e.g., detailed documentation)?\n\nThanks in advance for your collaboration,\n\nGuilherme Avelino\nPhD Student\nApplied Software Engineering Group (ASERG)\nUFMG, Brazil\nhttp://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/\n",

I'd suggest creating a google form survey and posting in the IRC channel `#pocoo`. But to answer one of you questions, I'd say @untitaker is the main contributor right now for sure. Although Armin makes big decisions, he is very busy with other projects.\n"
