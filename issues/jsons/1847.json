Happy to correct the docs if it's the latter.\n\nI'm attempting to use the large app structure seen in the [Flask Larger Applications documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/patterns/packages/)\n\nFirst, set up a virutal environment and install flask 0.11 into that environment (requirements.txt\nhas all that for you).\n\nCan successfully launch app using old `app.run()` mechanism found in `run.py` and `old_launch.sh`\n\n```\n$ python run.py\n```\n\nBut can't seem to get to work with flask-cli. You can see both of the methods in `new_launch.sh`.\n\nThis throws `ImportError - No module named server`:\n\n```\n$ FLASK_APP=server FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run\n```\n\nThis loads, but doesn't register any of the views even though the `Loading views...` print output makes it to the console.\n\n```\n$ FLASK_APP=server/__init__.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run\n```\n\nHow should I be loading a module with flask-cli? Or alternatively, how should I be changing the module structure to support it properly?\n",

I haven't run into it yet but admittedly, all my flask apps have been deployed by me rather than being open sourced for distribution. I was making this change based on the recommended guidance in the release notes to abandon `app.run()` in favor of the cli.\n\nWhile `export PYTHONPATH=pwd` didn't seem to help, reading the [documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/cli/) again, I found that `python -m flask run` fixed the short term problem for me. My final command:\n\n```\nFLASK_APP=server FLASK_DEBUG=1 python -m flask run\n```\n\nThis works fine.

Since the installation in editable mode is not a common pattern nor mentioned in the docs (right?), it would be nice to:\n- mention this issue as a note in the current stable Flask doc, for the cli chapter\n- change the behavior to add the current path or detect automatically if the path of the module has to be added.\n\nIt would avoid people trying to switch from `python manage.py ...` to the cli to be left scratching their heads :-).\n"
