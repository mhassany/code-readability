    "body": "I have a def that looks like this \n\n``` python\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    return render_template('main.html')\n```\n\nWhen trying to call this def I get \n\n```\nTypeError: index() takes 0 positional arguments but 2 were given\n```\n\nMost examples I've found doesn't pass any parameters into the def so I'm not sue why I have too?  How can I go about using my def without passing in parameters?\n\nSo for whatever reason I have to pass in 2 arguments for gunicorn so I change my code to look like this:\n\n``` python\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef index(arg1, arg2):\n    return render_template('main.html')\n```\n\nAfter passing in 2 parameters I get:\n\n```\n/python3.4/site-packages/flask/templating.py\", line 132, in render_template\n    ctx.app.update_template_context(context)\n\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'app'\n```\n\nIt appears by using gunicorn it doesn't appear it's setting up the correct context to use templates.  How would I go about setting up the 'app` context?\n",
