Most of them don't really belong into the app itself (except maybe X-Frame-Options when framing should be allowed in some case and CORS headers since setting these globally is rarely a good idea if you aren't doing an API)\r\n\r\nflask-secure-headers looks rather inactive (last commit 2015) and uses very poor coding practices (`from headers import *` - not only a wildcard import but also an implicit relative import that would most likely not work in PYthon 3) so I'd not even mention it.\r\n\r\nI'd focus on mentioning a single extension (flask-talisman looks quite good and, according to their repo's org name, seems to be developed by google) and not repeat the link to them but mention that this extension can handle all these headers if someone prefers to do it on the application level."
