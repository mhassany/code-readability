Since that file was removed from the current master branch via https://github.com/pallets/flask/commit/715a9a3e7bd65421c36428ba9d4a1ee06b98bbc1, all of the links to this script are broken.\r\n\r\nFor example, the docs for the version 0.12 uses this URL, which results in a 404:\r\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/pallets/flask/master/scripts/flaskext_compat.py\r\n\r\nAlso, the master branch version of the docs still show how to use this script that's been removed:\r\nhttps://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/master/docs/extensions.rst\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nViewing different versions of Flasks docs on flask.pocoo.org in Google Chrome 64 on Windows 10.",
