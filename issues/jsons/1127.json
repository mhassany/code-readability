The current approach is not just taken with Flask but it's used for all Pocoo projects and I would prefer to keep consistency between them.\n\nFurthermore currently when we do bugfixes, we simply make the fixes in the branch of the appropriate version and merge it into master. Introducing a separate development branch would make this more difficult and produce a redundancy between the latest version branch and master.\n\nI do see where you are coming from and we overall need a new strategy for anything related to the website and the documentation. However I think these issues are better solved by improving the tools and processes in that area. Read the docs would be an improvement for example although that has the annoying problem of requiring to reconfigure it manually with every release to show useful versions etc.\n"
