This should rule out all XSS problems caused in templates...\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nI'm able to inject code into the page.\r\n\r\nDemo: https://github.com/afd3dea/example1\r\n\r\nhttp://127.0.0.1/?m=<script>alert(1);</script> executes (assuming XSS Auditor / AV doesn't block it)\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: Python 3.6.7\r\n* Flask version: Tried on 0.12.1 and 1.0.2\r\n* Werkzeug version: ?",
