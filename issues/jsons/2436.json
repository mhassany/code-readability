    "body": "Based on discussion in #2023 and #641, Flask interferes too much with logging. This patch greatly reduces the logging configuration that Flask does.\r\n\r\n* Remove `LOGGER_NAME` and `LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY` configuration.\r\n* `app.logger` is always named `'flask.app'`. Use the `'flask'` namespace to allow other logging from Flask in the future.\r\n* Don't use a `Logger` subclass to override `getEffectiveLevel`. Call `setLevel` when the logger is first accessed, based on `app.debug`, instead of checking `debug` for every message.\r\n* Only one handler with one format is added, instead of different formats for production and development.\r\n* A handler is only added if there are no handlers configured that would handle the logger's `getEffectiveLevel`.\r\n* Handlers are never removed.\r\n* The `default_handler` is accessible so that it can be passed to `removeHandler` in case the user wants to get rid of the default handler after it is configured.\r\n* The proxy stream to `environ['wsgi.errors']` is exposed as `wsgi_errors_stream`, in case the user wants to use it in their own configuration.\r\n* Logging documentation is split from error handling documentation and reorganized to address the key concepts.\r\n* Added documentation for injecting request information into messages.\r\n* Logging tests are split into a separate module.\r\n* Some previously miscategorized tests are correctly organized.",
