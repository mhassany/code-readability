All templates are searched relatively to the root template directory. Although it seems that the `template_folder` Blueprint argument would have this meaning this is not actually the case. \nThis argument will only add the `template_folder` as one of the directories to search in. \n\nWith this change a template passed to `render_template` can be prefixed with `./` to indicate that it should not search in the root template directory, but in a subdirectory of it with the name of the blueprint.\n",
