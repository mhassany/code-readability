    "body": "Hi, I am new to flask and i am using the following [flask cookiecutter](https://github.com/sloria/cookiecutter-flask) to start with a quick prototype. The main idea of project is to collect data from hive cluster and push it to the end user using flask. \r\n\r\nAlthough, i was successfully able to connect flask to the hive server using `pyhive` connector but I am getting a weird issue that's the related to the `select limit` where i am trying to query more than 50 items.\r\n\r\nIn my case i built just Hive class similar to the flask extension development around  for `pyhive` similar  demo:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyhive import hive\r\nfrom flask import current_app\r\n\r\n# Find the stack on which we want to store the database connection.\r\n# Starting with Flask 0.9, the _app_ctx_stack is the correct one,\r\n# before that we need to use the _request_ctx_stack.\r\ntry:\r\n    from flask import _app_ctx_stack as stack\r\nexcept ImportError:\r\n    from flask import _request_ctx_stack as stack\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Hive(object):\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, app=None):\r\n        self.app = app\r\n        if app is not None:\r\n            self.init_app(app)\r\n\r\n    def init_app(self, app):\r\n        # Use the newstyle teardown_appcontext if it's available,\r\n        # otherwise fall back to the request context\r\n        if hasattr(app, 'teardown_appcontext'):\r\n            app.teardown_appcontext(self.teardown)\r\n        else:\r\n            app.teardown_request(self.teardown)\r\n\r\n    def connect(self):\r\n        return hive.connect(current_app.config['HIVE_DATABASE_URI'], database=\"orc\")\r\n\r\n    def teardown(self, exception):\r\n        ctx = stack.top\r\n        if hasattr(ctx, 'hive_db'):\r\n            ctx.hive_db.close()\r\n        return None\r\n\r\n    @property\r\n    def connection(self):\r\n        ctx = stack.top\r\n        if ctx is not None:\r\n            if not hasattr(ctx, 'hive_db'):\r\n                ctx.hive_db = self.connect()\r\n            return ctx.hive_db\r\n```\r\n\r\nand created an endpoint to load data from hive:\r\n```\r\n@blueprint.route('/hive/<limit>')\r\ndef connect_to_hive(limit):\r\n    cur = hive.connection.cursor()\r\n    query = \"select * from part_raw where year=2018 LIMIT {0}\".format(limit)\r\n    cur.execute(query)\r\n    res = cur.fetchall()\r\n    return jsonify(data=res)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the first run everything works fine if i try to load things with limited to 50 items, but as soon as i increase it keeps in state where nothing load. However when i load data using jupyter notebooks it works fine that's why i suspect  that i might missed something from my flask code.",
