Even after I installed ```foo``` as package. Looks like ```import``` inside flask application imports packages to some special namespace or context, where ```pickle``` or ```cPicke``` can't find them. I open this issue because I spent a day and didn't find any information about this. If someone know how to fix this, help me =)\r\n\r\n```pytb\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1997, in __call__\r\n    return self.wsgi_app(environ, start_response)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1985, in wsgi_app\r\n    response = self.handle_exception(e)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1540, in handle_exception\r\n    reraise(exc_type, exc_value, tb)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1982, in wsgi_app\r\n    response = self.full_dispatch_request()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1614, in full_dispatch_request\r\n    rv = self.handle_user_exception(e)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1517, in handle_user_exception\r\n    reraise(exc_type, exc_value, tb)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1612, in full_dispatch_request\r\n    rv = self.dispatch_request()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1598, in dispatch_request\r\n    return self.view_functions[rule.endpoint](**req.view_args)\r\n  File \"/path/flaskr/flaskr/blueprints/flaskr.py\", line 58, in index\r\n    my_foo = cPickle.load(f)\r\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'Foo'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: 2.7\r\n* Flask version:0.12.2\r\n* Werkzeug version:'0.12.2'\r\n",
