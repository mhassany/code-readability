    "body": "We're still using Python 2.7.6 for some projects which causes the exception listed below when trying to execute `flask run`. The problem appears to be when the run command executes `flask.cli._validate_key` which then checks for Python version 2.7 or above before attempting to access `ssl.SSLContext`. The problem with that is that SSLContext was only added in 2.7.9 so the check needs to be more exact by checking for versions 2.7.9 and above.\r\n\r\nRelevant tests already fail under Python 2.7.6 and have been updated so this patch doesn't require any additional tests as far as I can tell. Let me know if that is not the case.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/bin/flask\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(main())\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/cli.py\", line 894, in main\r\n    cli.main(args=args, prog_name=name)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/cli.py\", line 557, in main\r\n    return super(FlaskGroup, self).main(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 697, in main\r\n    rv = self.invoke(ctx)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 1064, in invoke\r\n    sub_ctx = cmd.make_context(cmd_name, args, parent=ctx)  \r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 621, in make_context\r\n    self.parse_args(ctx, args)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 880, in parse_args\r\n    value, args = param.handle_parse_result(ctx, opts, args)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 1404, in handle_parse_result\r\n    self.callback, ctx, self, value)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 78, in invoke_param_callback\r\n    return callback(ctx, param, value)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/cli.py\", line 693, in _validate_key\r\n    is_context = isinstance(cert, ssl.SSLContext)\r\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'SSLContext'\r\n```\r\n\r\nVersion information:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ flask --version\r\nFlask 1.0.2\r\nPython 2.7.6 (default, Jun 22 2015, 17:58:13) \r\n[GCC 4.8.2]\r\n```",
