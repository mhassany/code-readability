    "body": "Hi \r\n   When I use Flask as my web server, I meet a diffcult problem.\r\n   Because of network problem, the flask server sometimes hang forever(The client build a connection to server and then died before send anything). And I found it hanged at socket read function. The server was started by  \"app.run()\" (The way you don't suggest to use) . So I readed the flask and werkzeug code and found werkzeug didn't set socket timeout default. So I must writed a class extends serving.WSGIRequestHandler and set the timeout = 0.5 and  made it as a parameter for \"app.run()\" , it worked well.\r\n\r\n But there was another problem, I couldn't run this server in multi-thread mode, because when I used flask commod to run this server, there was no way to set timeout, it didn't make \"app.run()\" as the  start point\u3002\r\n\r\nI also tried gunicorn and still couldn't find a way both set timeout and run server in muti-thread mode. \r\n\r\nwhat should I do ?",
