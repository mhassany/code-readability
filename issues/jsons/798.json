Then you visit `/` again, it should not send a `Set-Cookie` since session is not changed, but it actually will send `Set-Cookie`\n\nThis is the problem!\n\n@gregorynicholas Have you ever noticed that your server is always sending a `Set-Cookie`?\n\nLet's have a look at the python code:\n\n``` py\n    def save_session(self, app, session, response):\n        domain = self.get_cookie_domain(app)\n        path = self.get_cookie_path(app)\n        if not session:\n            if session.modified:\n                response.delete_cookie(app.session_cookie_name,\n                                       domain=domain, path=path)\n            return\n        httponly = self.get_cookie_httponly(app)\n        secure = self.get_cookie_secure(app)\n        expires = self.get_expiration_time(app, session)\n        val = self.get_signing_serializer(app).dumps(dict(session))\n        response.set_cookie(app.session_cookie_name, val,\n                            expires=expires, httponly=httponly,\n                            domain=domain, path=path, secure=secure)\n```\n\nAfter step 2, session will not be None, and in this case, it will always go down to the end of the code, and the response will set the session cookie again.\n"

            "body": "+1 on what @methane said.\n\nImagine a web page that issues two ajax requests simultaneously.  One is fast and the other is slow.  The fast one changes the session.  The slow one doesn't.  If the session cookie is written as part of every single response, then the fast ajax request will update the session and this update will get reverted when the slow request returns.\n\nSetting SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST = False fixes this problem, so I think this is a good change.  Personally I think this should be the default, but that would be a breaking change so I understand the hesitation.\n\nLooks like Flask 0.10.1 is the latest release in PyPi.  If I wanted to use this feature, what's the cleanest way to get it?  For now I just downloaded a copy of latest master code as a zip file and added it to my requirements.txt file.\n"
