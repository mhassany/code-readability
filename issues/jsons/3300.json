Maybe someone also has ideas how to improve search engine stuff since pallets flask docs seem to be really hard to find right now.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what should happen. -->\r\n\r\nSearching for \"flask documentation\" on google.com or duckduckgo.com, https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/ should be listed higher up, but at least the documentation on http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/ should have links to the newer documentation.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what happens instead. -->\r\n\r\nPallets documentation is hard to find and the only link from Pocoo to Pallets seems to be on http://www.pocoo.org/ itself.",
