            "body": "The documentation is missing context on what is considered a \"relative\" URL in this example. Consider the following:\r\n\r\nThis behavior allows relative URLs to continue working even if the trailing slash is omitted, consistent with how Apache and other servers work. If there is a slash at the end of the URL, as per `/projects/`, relative URLs (such as `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">`) will resolve to `/projects/style.css`. However, URLs with no slash on the end, such as `/about`, will resolve to the slash closest to the end, in this example `/style.css`.\r\n\r\nThe phrase that I have left out, \"Also, the URLs will stay unique, which helps search engines avoid indexing the same page twice.\", I believe would be better fitted appended to the first paragraph of that section, as it directly relates only to the redirect for that single case."
