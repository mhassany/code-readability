    "body": "I'm preparing for my PyCon tutorial, for which I'm trying to look at things from the perspective of a beginner. The output of `flask run` is actually very confusing if you don't have a bit of background. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(venv) $ flask run\r\n* Environment: production\r\n  WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.\r\n  Use a production WSGI server instead.\r\n* Debug mode: off\r\n* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst of all, is this a development server? How would you know if you are new to Flask? And more importantly, we are told that we shouldn't use the development server in a production environment. But the line right above appears to claim the current environment is production!\r\n\r\nI would like to propose a rewording of this warning to avoid ambiguous terms such as \"environment\". My proposal:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.\r\n  Use a production WSGI server instead.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

The above link is about development mode, but if I am understanding this (and I'm not sure I am) this is not just about development \"mode\" per se, but about the fact that Flask is not meant to be a production web server.  There is an interesting blog post here: https://vsupalov.com/flask-web-server-in-production/ which makes sound like Flask is really TWO servers: an application server and a web server, and while the application server portion may be well and good for production, \"Flask\u2019s built-in [web] server is not suitable for production as it doesn\u2019t scale well and by default serves only one request at a time.\"  Is that correct?  And isn't that really what this error message is intending to warn about (i.e. not just the fact of being in \"development\" mode)??  If so, then I would want a link to some documentation that explains the difference between a \"development server\" and \"a production WSGI server\"."

(Furthermore, even though I was the one to bring up the idea: pointing to specific documents in an error message is NOT best practices because inevitably the link will break because sooner or later the document will be moved!)  That said, I strongly stand by my earlier comment that use of the pronoun \"this\" is vague.  **If the warning is meant to convey that \"Flask\" itself should _never_ be used as a production _web_ service, then the warning message should say so very explicitly** (and potentially the warning can do so in a way that is even a little shorter than what Miguel originally proposed, if we really want short).  Once it is very explicit, googling about deploying flask is likely adequate to clarify the matter."

(Obviously, that would be bad design, but I think we've all seen contextually inappropriate warnings.) Maybe add something like \"Flask's development web server is running!\"?\r\n\r\nThat would make the message:\r\n> WARNING: Flask's development web server is running! Flask contains a web server FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY!\r\n\r\nI was going to suggest changing the IP line from \"Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/\" to \"Web server running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/\". However, that line comes from Werkzeug, which is actually doing the serving. In other words, it's arguably more accurate to say that Flask contains Werkzeug which contains a webserver... I don't think that makes the message misleading, but it is a bit incomplete, so I thought I'd mention that."
