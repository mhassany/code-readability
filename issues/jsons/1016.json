Having a default category is the simplest way to fix this problem.\n\nAs @ThiefMaster mentioned, these categories are user-defined and we are also not going to add any so nobody is ever going to have to do any duplicating.\n\nFurthermore in 3.4 the idiomatic way to define several categories is with an enum and not with constants. This means that your proposed solution is not really idiomatic in the long term and argueably it clashes with our Python 3 first and Python 2 later approach to porting.\n\nThis leaves the option of actually using an enum but for Python 2 that means implementing them in _compat or adding a dependency on a backport. I don't think that's worth it.\n"
