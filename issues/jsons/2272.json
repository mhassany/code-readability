    "body": "Hello! Flask logs urls as encoded strings. For example if I have route with cyrillic characters: @app.route('/\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442') (https://gist.github.com/dima74/5e025da90ee90a78b65bc3e3c69623ea), than flask will log \"GET /%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82 HTTP/1.1\". It would be very nice if there is option to get that Flask logs urls decoded. (Thanks for Flask!)",
