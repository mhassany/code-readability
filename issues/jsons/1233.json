This is why most of the work is intensive discussion and reading of RFCs (mostly in Werkzeug) or coming up with sensible (or rather, foolproof) APIs (mostly in Flask).\n- Mentoring is extremely time-consuming for both sides, but introducing such a formal process implies to me that there is somebody working full-time on Flask/Werkzeug, so i don't think mentoring is applicable in Flask's case, while it probably is in Mozilla's.\n- If you are interested in fixing an issue, i'd suggest to comment on it to see whether anybody else is currently doing anything related, otherwise you may ask where to start. I can't really see how in Flask's case, a mentoring process would give you quicker response times than this strategy.\n- One bug that doesn't require deep knowledge of Flask's or Werkzeug's internals, but still is a lot of work would be https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/issues/1135 -- there we'd have to write a tool that automatically fixes the codebase of a Flask user, given that `flask.ext` is going to be deprecated.\n- Anything with the 1.0 milestone (and as mentioned, any doc issues) are worthwhile fixing in the near future.\n"
