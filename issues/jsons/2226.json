    "body": "Stack Overflow gets a *constant* stream of questions about 400 errors that are caused by missing keys. The fact that accessing `args`, `form`, `files`, `values`, `session`, and `headers` returns an HTTP error instead of a traceback is confusing to a lot of users; they get no feedback about what went wrong and it's easy to miss typos or a missing name attribute. This config should default to the value of `DEBUG` and the behavior should be much more clearly documented.",
