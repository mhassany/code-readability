    "body": "I am hoping to create two types of logs:\n- `access.log`: lists all requests made on the flask application\n- `error.log`: lists all warnings, and errors made within the flask application\n\nCurrently, I have defined [`app.py`](https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/9b53741fadae3d8f6cbf72ce76f0086d55779c69/app.py#L16-L27), which contains logic recycled from a gist [comment](https://gist.github.com/ibeex/3257877#gistcomment-946336):\n\n``` python\nimport logging\nfrom logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler\nfrom interface import app\napp.run(host='0.0.0.0')\n\nLOG_FILENAME = '/vagrant/log/access.log'\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter(\n    \"[%(asctime)s] {%(pathname)s:%(lineno)d} %(levelname)s - %(message)s\")\nhandler = RotatingFileHandler(LOG_FILENAME, maxBytes=10000000, backupCount=5)\nhandler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\napp.logger.addHandler(handler)\n\nlog = logging.getLogger('werkzeug')\nlog.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\nlog.addHandler(handler)\n```\n\nWhen I adjust my application, by making an unnecessary typo in the logic; or conversely, if I complete a successful post request on my application, nothing gets logged into `/vagrant/log/access.log`.  However, the `/vagrant/log/access.log` file is created, and empty.  Is the above logic equivalent to the `error.log` that I had intended?  If so, how can I correct this, while also creating a functional `/vagrant/log/access.log`?\n",
