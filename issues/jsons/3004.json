            "body": "Thanks @davidism , fair enough.  I found it hard to find the `--host` and `--port` arguments, and I didn't think to try `flask run --help` even though I am reasonably familiar with command line tools.  (I did run `flask --help`.)  It was quite easy to find `app.run(host='blah')` (despite the warning that you should not use the development server in production), so I was trying to put these command line options on a similar level of visibility.  But I understand your comments.  Since I use `git <subcommand> --help` quite often maybe I should have thought of `flask run --help` so maybe it's fine :-)"
