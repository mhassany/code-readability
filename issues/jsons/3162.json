    "body": "- Added that an empty `FLASK_APP` environment variable will also look for an `app` package in addition to the two files.\r\n- Added instructions for running Gunicorn with an app factory that lacks an explicit application instance but has a function that returns one.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Gunicorn update, perhaps the other application servers should have a similar update? It looks like uWSGI takes the same type of arguments as Gunicorn. Perhaps others more familiar with those apps can offer how to handle the same type of application I've updated the Gunicorn documentation for?"
