    "body": "I wrote some code for on-demand thumbnail generation but ran in to some weirdness with `send_from_directory`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n\r\n# Just a relative directory called \"thumbs\" that's supposed to hold a replica directory tree, only with thumbnails\r\nthumbcache = 'thumbs'\r\n\r\n# ...\r\n\r\n@app.route('/thumb/<path:path>')\r\ndef thumbnail(path):\r\n    \r\n    # Simple True/False return for success/failure.\r\n    success = cache_thumbnail(path)\r\n    if not success:\r\n        raise Exception(\"Thumbnail generation failed!\")\r\n\r\n    # All thumbnails are jpg so I need to replace the file extension:\r\n    thumbpath, _ = os.path.splitext(path)\r\n    thumbpath += \".jpg\"\r\n\r\n    ## thumbpath = thumbpath.replace('\\\\', '/')\r\n\r\n    #return send_file(thumbcache + '/' + thumbpath)\r\n    return send_from_directory(thumbcache, thumbpath)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `'/thumb/<path:path>` URL is being generated by: \r\n```html\r\n<img id=\"{{loop.index}}\" src=\"{{ url_for('thumbnail', path=file) }}\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe requests look like: `\"GET /thumb/gw%5Calpha%5C1430f690aa3fcfda5c10beceb9c120ea.jpg HTTP/1.1\"`\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe code above, as is, results in a 404 - File not found error. No exception.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe file should be served.\r\n\r\nIf I uncomment the line `return send_file(thumbcache + '/' + thumbpath)` and thereby bypassing any security, it works but that's an undesirable workaround.\r\n\r\nIf I uncomment the line `thumbpath = thumbpath.replace('\\\\', '/')` to replace all backslashes with forward slashes, it works fine.  \r\nI don't know why `url_for` generated backslashes in the first place. Maybe an artifact because I am running this code on a Windows machine?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: Python 3.5.2 (v3.5.2:4def2a2901a5, Jun 25 2016, 22:18:55) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32\r\n* Flask version: 0.12.2\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.12.2\r\n",
