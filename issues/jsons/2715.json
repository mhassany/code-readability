Note you would need to port over some of the plugins like for Paypal, which is 1200 lines.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is even possible to have some if Django and if Flask lines and keep it all in one codebase.\r\n\r\nI realize this is not an easy bug, but maybe if enough people are interested, something could happen one day.",
