    "body": "I see that version 1.0 includes a lot of significant changes. It may be reasonable to change the default value of option `TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD` to `False`. It will reduce mostly useless interaction with the hard drive and positive impact on performance.\n\nI think most apps that use Flask will never change the template files on the fly in production, so this change is not reflected in their stability. For other cases, it remains possible to explicitly set the value to `True`. And of course, it will not affect the debugging capabilities.\n\nMore explanation in related PR: #876. It's merged, but default value is set to `True` for backward compatibility.\n\n@untitaker, @kennethreitz what do you think about this?\n",
