    "body": "I recently added message flashing to one of my apps, and noticed that it started re-issuing the session cookie on _every_ response.\n\nA bit of digging revealed that `get_flashed_messages()` calls `session.pop('_flashes')` without first checking to see if `session['_flashes']` is missing or empty.  This has a side effect of triggering `ModificationTrackingDict.on_update()`, which in turn marks the session as modified even though it wasn't.  It happens even when no flash messages are set.\n\nThe fix should be easy.  Replace this part of `get_flashed_messages()`:\n\n```\nif flashes is None:\n    _request_ctx_stack.top.flashes = flashes = session.pop('_flashes', [])\n```\n\nWith something like this:\n\n```\nif flashes is None and '_flashes' in session:\n    _request_ctx_stack.top.flashes = flashes = session.pop('_flashes')\nelse:\n    _request_ctx_stack.top.flashes = flashes =  []\n```\n",
