It would attempt to import yourapplication and then looks for an object called \"app\".  If it finds that it uses that, otherwise you would have to do (yourapplication:application) or something.  Then it runs that with the development server.\n\nWhat would that solve?\n\nFirst of all it would no longer require `if __name__ == '__main__'`, secondly it would solve the double importing problems we commonly see as well as the fact that modules work different to applications.  Lastly the application object would no longer have to be a Flask application object but just any WSGI application object.\n",

If not, should it be in Werkzeug instead?\n\nOne scenario that seems common (IMO) is to have the debug mode disabled in the application code for production, but enable it in the script starting the development server. I would like a built-in Flask script to support this. As the debug mode is more that use_debugger and use_reloader, this contradicts the idea of supporting any WSGI object.
