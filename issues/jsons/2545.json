    "body": "In `flask/config.py` when loading a config file in `silent=True` mode, can you add ENOTDIR as part of the errnos that are absorbed?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/789715adb9949f58b7b0272bed1a58d7cd0fad30/flask/config.py#L132  (and the other similar lines)\r\n\r\nI've installed a package with pip, which stores its settings into directory `~/.grip` as one of the potential locations to store its config flags. But the ubuntu package grip uses the same path as a regular file.\r\nWhen the python-grip tries `config.from_pyfile(x, silent=True)` to figure out its settings, it borks.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely a packaging bug with the grip tools to use the same path to store their settings (and I'll file that with them), but it remains that I believe in the case of loading config files, passing a non-existent file should silently fail. I don't see the case as being that different than EISDIR (which is already handled).\r\n\r\nI'm happy to do a pull request on this.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen loading a config with `Config.from_pyfile()` and friends, from a path in which a (non-basename) component in the path is a regular file, I would expect the config loading to silently fail when `silent=True`,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nPaste a minimal example that causes the problem.\r\n```\r\n\r\n    # I use Xresources here, because it probably already exists on most systems. but in my\r\n    # case it's \".grip\".\r\n    import os, os.path\r\n    import flask\r\n    APPNAME = \"Xresources\"\r\n    SETTINGS_FILE = os.path.expanduser(\r\n        os.path.join(\"~\", \".\" + APPNAME, \"settings.py\"))\r\n\r\n    cfg = flask.Config(\".\")\r\n\r\n    # borks -- ~/.Xresources already exists as a regular file\r\n    cfg.from_pyfile(SETTINGS_FILE, silent=True)\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nENOTDIR is not absorbed and is raised.\r\n\r\n```pytb\r\nPaste the full traceback if there was an exception.\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File \"sample.py\", line 11, in <module>\r\n        cfg.from_pyfile(SETTINGS_FILE, silent=True)\r\n      File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/flask/config.py\", line 129, in from_pyfile\r\n        with open(filename, mode='rb') as config_file:\r\n    IOError: [Errno 20] Unable to load configuration file (Not a directory): \r\n    '/home/me/.Xresources/settings.py'\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: 2.7.x\r\n* Flask version: 0.12.2\r\n* Werkzeug version: x\r\n\r\n\r\n"
