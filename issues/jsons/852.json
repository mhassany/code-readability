    "body": " Installation\n\nFlask depends on two external libraries, Werkzeug and Jinja2. Werkzeug is a toolkit for WSGI, the standard Python interface between web applications and a variety of servers for both development and deployment. Jinja2 renders templates.\n\nSo how do you get all that on your computer quickly? There are many ways you could do that, but the most kick-ass method is virtualenv, so let's have a look at that first.\n\nYou will need Python 2.6 or higher to get started, so be sure to have an up-to-date Python 2.x installation. For using Flask with Python 3 have a look at :ref:`python3-support`.\n\n:ref:`python3-support` should be :ref:`python3_support`.\n",
