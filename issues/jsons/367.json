            "body": "> Then the consumer should reject the request, instead of trying to parse the body and failing, no?\n\nWerkzeug does not generate responses by itself, that's up for the developer. The question is if we should automatically reject chunked requests in Flask and there I don't know yet. I was always hoping that WSGI servers would advertise their ability to handle chunked requests but it does not seem like there is a consistent way they do that.\n\n> Also, this changelog: http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ChangesInVersion0300 indicates that mod_wsgi, for one, is capable of parsing chunked requests (even though it doesn't support actual buffering of them).\n\nYes. But from the view of Werkzeug I cannot find out if a WSGI server extends the WSGI spec to support chunked requests.  And if I assume it does I can cause a timeout on the client.\n\nThe problem is that WSGI specifies that one should read up to Content-Length. This header is missing if chunked requests are being handled. But then there are two situations. Either the WSGI server unpacks the chunked requests for us and we're good to read from the stream until the stream stops by itself or the WSGI server does not and if we try to do we request too much data from the client and the connection stalls waiting for more bytes that never get transmitted.\n"

My test results calling at each of the layers:\n- ELB - times out after 60s\n- Nginx - appears to buffer all the content and then return the response\n- Flask (directly using the werkzeug server) - Returns an HTTP 1.0 header (see after the fragment) and then transmits content until complete\n\nHere's the code snippet I am using for experimenting:\n\n```\nfrom flask import Flask, Response, stream_with_context\nimport time\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/streamit', methods=['GET'])\ndef streamit():\n    def generator():\n        for x in xrange(70):\n            time.sleep(1.0)\n            yield ' '\n        yield '<html><body>done</body></html>'\n    return Response(stream_with_context(generator()))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n\n# Run this script and then testing using:\n#   curl -v -N http://localhost:5000/streamit\n```\n\nCurl output:\n\n```\n$ curl -v -N http://localhost:5000/streamit\n* About to connect() to localhost port 5000 (#0)\n*   Trying ::1...\n* Adding handle: conn: 0x7f96d180aa00\n* Adding handle: send: 0\n* Adding handle: recv: 0\n* Curl_addHandleToPipeline: length: 1\n* - Conn 0 (0x7f96d180aa00) send_pipe: 1, recv_pipe: 0\n*   Trying 127.0.0.1...\n* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 5000 (#0)\n> GET /streamit HTTP/1.1\n> User-Agent: curl/7.33.0\n> Host: localhost:5000\n> Accept: */*\n> \n* HTTP 1.0, assume close after body\n< HTTP/1.0 200 OK\n< Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n< Connection: close\n< Server: Werkzeug/0.9.3 Python/2.7.5\n< Date: Mon, 27 Jan 2014 22:48:30 GMT\n< \n                                                                      <html><body>done</body></html>* Closing connection 0\n```\n"
