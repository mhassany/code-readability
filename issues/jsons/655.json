    "body": "If you submit a field with an integer and commit to DB as a string, SQLite will cast it to an integer, which can cause problems.\n\nI was making something based on the Flask tutorial and I couldn't figure out why my data was coming back as type \"int\" when I had inserted to the DB as \"string\".\n\nThe field needs to be something that has text-affinity in SQLite, so I changed it to type \"text\".\n\nHope this helps?\n"
