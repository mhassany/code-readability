If I call `url_for` in `post()` or `dispatch_request()` of my AuthAPI view class, it's already broken.\r\n\r\nCalling `client.post(url_for(\"api.auth\"), json={...})` multiple times does not undo the problem.\r\n\r\n### Relevant Code\r\n\r\n- The test that is failing: https://github.com/Kangaroux/Kanban/blob/master/tests/user/test_user.py#L75\r\n- The test app and client: https://github.com/Kangaroux/Kanban/blob/master/tests/conftest.py#L39\r\n- The full app factory: https://github.com/Kangaroux/Kanban/blob/master/config/app.py#L9\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version: 3.6.5\r\n* Flask version: 1.0.2\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.14.1\r\n",
