So if there wasn't a specific handler registered, it wouldn't fall back to a more general handler, which people found confusing. ~But it *was* possible to add a handler specifically for the `301` code and have different redirect behavior. Why you would do that, I don't know, but it was possible.~ And since `RequestRedirect` wasn't part of the `werkzeug.exceptions.default_exceptions` map, a handler for 301 wouldn't have matched it anyway.\r\n\r\nI'm OK with saying that anyone who really wants to catch `RequestRedirect` should override `handle_http_exception` or `url_map` to do something different. Or if they want to redirect using exceptions, they can create their own `class Found(HTTPException): code = 302` and add a handler for that."
