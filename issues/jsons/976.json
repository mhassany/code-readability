See #963 for details on that issue and the direction Armin is taking the situation with the documents..\n\nAs you can see [here](https://flask.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/setup/#tutorial-setup) the newest version recommends setting an absolute path to `/tmp/flaskr.db` thereby eliminating the `import os` requirement.\n"
