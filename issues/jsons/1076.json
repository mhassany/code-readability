    "body": "Steps to reproduce:\nWrite a trivial flask app, include a call to pdb.set_trace() in the request path, then request this url (browser, curl, ...). You're now in a pdb session. But at the same time flask's reloader is watching imported modules of your app for changes. Make a change in one of these modules (mod.py) and save the file. The reloader will restart your application, and abort your pdb session. Now you can stop the application with Ctrl+C. Result: your terminal no longer echos input.\n\nIsolated test case:\nhttps://gist.github.com/numerodix/c13ce7c1c0917b3b7dd9\n",
