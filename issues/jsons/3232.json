    "body": "Added a new class `flask.testing.EnvironBuilder` inheriting from `werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder`. \r\n\r\nLogic from `make_test_environ_builder()` moved to the constructor of that class, and changed to simply instantiate the class, while issuing a `DeprecationWarning`.\r\n\r\nI did explore making `json_dumps()` a regular method rather than a static method, to pick up `app`, but if anything was expecting to call `EnvironBuilder.json_dumps()` as a static method then this would break. Requires funky descriptor tricks to work both as a static method and an instance method under Python 2 and so didn't seem worth the code it would take.\r\n\r\ncloses #3207 ",
