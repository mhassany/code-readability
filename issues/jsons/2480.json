The mailing list is open to all, however.\r\n\r\nWithout even getting into the code, critiques:\r\n\r\n* Any modern Flask example should be using `setup.py` to install in development mode and set up requirements. `pip install -e .`\r\n* This tries to be a one-size-fits-all example, which are usually way too complicated for beginners and way too opinionated for advanced uses, especially with Flask's focus on flexibility.\r\n* Your requirements should be direct dependencies, not an exhaustive list. See pipenv if you want to lock requirements.\r\n* Uses direct SQL for schema management rather than a migration library (Alembic).\r\n* Uses Tornado as a server. Tornado itself recommends against using it for WSGI apps.\r\n* Does not use the `flask` command or dev server during development.\r\n* Puts config in a location inside the package code, which is not recommended for packages installed in production. Use the instance folder."
