There are slight differences in between the versioning listed below. One server is already set-up and it is working well following the steps from the above link to configure logging integrated with gunicorn log file. However, when i followed the same approach to configure in a newer versions environment, those app.logger.info() message did not log to the gunicorn log file. I suspect it may be due to the change in 0.12 release. Any idea? \r\n\r\nVersion 0.12\r\nReleased on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.\r\n...\r\n**Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.**\r\n...\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nWorking Environment\r\n* Python version: 2.7.12\r\n* Flask version: 0.11.1\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.11.11\r\n\r\nNot Working Environment\r\n* Python version: 2.7.13\r\n* Flask version: 0.12.0\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.11.15\r\n",
