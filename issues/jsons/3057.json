To see the HTML changes, the browser must be manually refreshed.  I did not expect this to be the case.  I am unsure if this is a bug or intended behavior of the Flask development server.\r\n\r\nIf this behavior is intended, I would like to have this considered for a Feature Request for the Flask development server.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* Python version:  3.6.3\r\n* Flask version: 1.0.2\r\n* Werkzeug version: 0.14.1\r\n",

I also tried using various configurations of `server.watch`, none of which helped.  After some trial and error, I think my issue has to do with the use of the Blueprint design pattern."
