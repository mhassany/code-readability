    "body": "I don't have a good description for the issue yet but one of the issues I keep running into myself in 2017 is that it's not convenient to marry Flask and webpack. The issue here is that one wants to both have a server app as well as a client app and each uses a hot reloader for code.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of boilerplate to make two services work and there is absolutely no support on the side of Flask to make it work. So here is what Flask most likely should do:\r\n\r\n# Environment Awareness\r\n\r\nFlask needs to know about environments. For now I would propose to mirror the node model where we have an environment flag and depending on the environment flag some flags get flipped automatically. In development for instance we would turn on debug by default. This discourages apps to make too many assumptions about the debug flag but instead use an environment flag instead.\r\n\r\nThis means debug can be flipped on and off in development mode. A potential webpack integration extension can then forward that flag to webpack.\r\n\r\n# Proxy or be-proxied Capabilities\r\n\r\nRight now one either needs front/backend to be running different servers on different ports or use some manual proxy setup to make this work. Right now the webpack server can pass through to the Flask server but it's quite hacky and non trivial.\r\n\r\nIn an ideal case Flask in development mode can spawn another process (like a webpack server, ngrok etc.) and manage this process. It would work independently of the Flask reloader but shut down together.\r\n\r\nIf it spawns a process on a different port Flask should itself be proxied through that other server or proxy to another server if that's easier. This would most likely require that the Werkzeug server learns HTTP proxying as we might not be able to do this on the WSGI level.",
