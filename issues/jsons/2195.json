    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am using flask for a small web service that my mobile applications use.\r\n\r\nI was developing the server on a normal Windows Desktop and port forwarding it through my personal home router. \r\n\r\nI am now at the deployment stage, and I am having trouble with connections on Windows Server 2008.\r\n\r\nThe flask server runs successfully, and all endpoints are reachable on localhost, but I cannot connect from an external source. I know that the port forwarding is correct, as I have added another test application to Windows IIS to confirm that it wasn't the router's port forwarding, and that test application worked.\r\n\r\nHoping someone has an idea.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nConnor\r\n\r\nThe issue tracker is a tool to address bugs.\r\nPlease use the #pocoo IRC channel on freenode or Stack Overflow for questions.\r\n",
