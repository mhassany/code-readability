    "body": "When enabling debug mode via `app.run(debug=True)`, code changes result in an auto-reload but Jinja templates are cached until the app is manually is restarted.\n\nAt https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/21d595bee73e65a28201709bd1a8b97c42aff5d2/flask/app.py#L695 Flask checks if the `config[\"TEMPLATE_AUTO_RELOAD\"]` is explicitly set. If not, Jinja's `options[\"auto_reload\"]` is set to `app.debug`.\n\nHowever, if you instantiate your Flask object _then_ call `app.run(debug=True)` without loading a config, template auto reloading is not enabled (`app.debug` was `False` when the Flask app was instantiated).\n\nAt https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/21d595bee73e65a28201709bd1a8b97c42aff5d2/flask/app.py#L839 we enable reloading code and enable the debugger. My proposed fix would be to also enable template reloading (`jinja_env.auto_reload = self.debug`) here.\n\nThis would result is less confusion (\"Debug is enabled but my templates don't auto reload\") and make the template reloading behaviour consistent with the code reloading behaviour (\"If no config is set or `debug` is not explicitly set in config, and the site calls `app.run(debug=True)`, then enable the relevant auto reloading features\").\n",

Instantiate my `Flask` app\n2. Add some routes\n3. Call `app.run(debug=True)`\n\n... the issue does not manifest. I can alter templates and they are reloaded as expected.\n\nThis works because the `jinja_env` isn't actually initialised until _after_ `app.run(debug=True)` is called (so it's seeing `app.debug == True`).\n\nHowever, if I ...\n1. Instantiate my `Flask` app\n2. Add some routes\n3. **Access my `app.jinja_env` object (thereby initialising the Jinja2 environment)**\n4. Call `app.run(debug=True)`\n\n... template auto-reloading doesn't work as expected.\n\nThis is because accessing `app.jinja_env` creates the Jinja environment, reading `app.debug` before `app.run(debug=True)` sets it to `True`.\n\nI think the issue still stands despite the narrower impact of only affecting users who access the `jinja_env`.\n\nIn my case, I'm adding Jinja2 global before calling `app.run(debug=True)` which has the unexpected side effect of disabling template auto-reloading and never re-enabling it when I'm running under debug mode.\n\nIt seems like a simple change, so if there are no objections I'd like to try to fix this and create a PR for it.\n"

It seems the template changes did take affect after you reload. However the flask app in terminal did not say anything about detection on the html file. Maybe we can add some sort of detection on there to let developers know what file was changed.\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.jinja_env.cache = {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this helps out some people. \r\n\r\nCheers!

This is at least what I've observed. \r\n\r\nThanks to folks here on the resolution, saved me some trouble. \ud83d\ude3a "
