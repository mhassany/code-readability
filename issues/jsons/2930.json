I didn't know of `exists_ok`, but I found an interesting bug report about it: https://bugs.python.org/issue13498. Things now seem much less simple to me... :-)\r\n\r\nIn the end, as you asked, what really matters was if I had a precise use case in mind. And... no. ^^ So I think you're right, the tutorial is better as it is now than with this change (feel free to close this PR, or should I?)\r\n\r\nThanks for the review!"
