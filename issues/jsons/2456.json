    "body": "### Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\n   I have a simple function to get json data from a website using \"POST\" method, for convenience, I save it as get_music.py file. Here is the code.\r\n   ```python\r\nimport requests\r\ndef get_music():\r\n    baseUrl = \"http://music.163.com/api/search/get/\"\r\n    parameters = {\r\n        's': \"acg\",\r\n        'limit': 100,\r\n        'type': 1\r\n    }\r\n    response = requests.post(baseUrl, data=parameters)\r\n    answer = response.json()\r\n    return answer\r\n```\r\nand when we call the function, a json data will returned, that's no problems. But when i call it in the views function, things become strange. here is views.py.\r\n```python\r\nfrom .get_music import get_music\r\nfrom flask import render_template\r\nfrom . import main\r\n\r\n@main.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\r\ndef index():\r\n    music = get_music()\r\n    return render_template(\"index.html\", music=music)\r\n```\r\n  When I run the flask program, the json data is \" {'msg': \"Request method 'GET' not supported\", 'code': 400}\", it's not correct. \r\n  After debug i found the request method is \"GET\" when i use flask, but if  run the get_music.py without flask , the request method is \"POST\". it's any problem in views funtion change the request method?\r\n",
