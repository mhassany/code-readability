    "body": "I had a `.flaskenv` file for running an example, and when I tried to run the tests, one of them called `app.run` which called `load_dotenv` and changed the debug flag for future tests. Can also reproduce by just setting the env var and running in a terminal, without dotenv.\r\n\r\nNeed a pytest fixture to clear these vars at the beginning of the session, and to reset them after each test.\r\n\r\nWorking on this, just creating the issue for tracking."
