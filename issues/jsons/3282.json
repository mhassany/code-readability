    "body": "#2436 greatly simplified how logging is set up in Flask. Part of that removed the `LOGGER_NAME` config and hard-coded `\"flask.app\"`. However, #2866 points out that due to this it is no longer possible to distinguish logs when dispatching multiple apps.\r\n\r\nThis partially reverts the logger name behavior change from 1.0. There is still no config, but the logger's name is now the same as `app.name` (basically the value passed to `Flask(import_name)`).\r\n\r\nThe information that's currently logged does make sense as coming from the user's project rather than Flask itself, although we may introduce the `\"flask.app\"` logger again in the future for logging things truly internal to Flask and not the user's app.\r\n\r\nThis may require projects to update their logging config to reference their app's name instead of `\"flask.app\"`.\r\n\r\nCloses #2866 ",
