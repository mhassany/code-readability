    "body": "Dear Flask Team,\n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH for developing such a delightful platform.\nI truly love my work in large part because of Flask!\n\nI have an opportunity to 'give back' to the Flask community. I would like to submit an extension for listing in the Flask Extension Registry, and have it accepted as an Approved Extension.\n\nWarmly,\nLing.\n\nExtension: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-User\nVersion: v0.3.6\n\nI have followed your guidelines below:\n\no. An approved Flask extension requires a maintainer.\n\n   Maintainer: Ling Thio <ling.thio [at] gmail.com>\n   Repository: https://github.com/lingthio/flask-user\n1. An approved Flask extension must provide exactly one package or module named flask_extensionname.\n   \n   Module: flask_user\n2. It must ship a testing suite that can either be invoked with make test or python setup.py test.\n   \n   python setup.py test\n   Runs automated tests and coverage currently runs at 98%.\n3. APIs of approved extensions will be checked\n   \n   UserManager.**init**(app) sets self.app = app\n   UserManager.init_app(app) does NOT set self.app\n4. The license must be BSD/MIT/WTFPL licensed.\n   \n   BSD License\n5. The naming scheme for official extensions\n   \n   Flask-User\n6. Approved extensions must define all their dependencies in the setup.py file\n   \n   mkvirtualenv test  # brand new env\n   pip install flask-user\n   can run the flask_user/example_apps/basic_app.py\n7. The extension must have documentation that uses one of the two Flask themes for Sphinx documentation.\n   \n   See http://pythonhosted.org//Flask-User/\n8. The setup.py description (and thus the PyPI description) has to link to...\n   \n   The documentation: http://pythonhosted.org//Flask-User/\n   Home page: https://github.com/lingthio/flask-user\n   Bug track: https://github.com/lingthio/flask-user/issues\n   Development version: n/a\n9. The zip_safe flag in the setup script must be set to False\n   \n   setup.py:\n       zip_safe=False,\n10. An extension currently has to support Python 2.6 as well as Python 2.7\n    \n    Travis-CI runs Flask-Utils on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3\n",
