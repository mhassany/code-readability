    "body": "Werkzeug's `EnvironBuilder` gained a `json_dumps` attribute, but Flask doesn't have an `EnvironBuilder` subclass right now to take advantage of that, and there's no way to configure the `Client` to use a different builder class anyway. Might be good to refactor `flask.testing.make_test_environ_builder` to be an `EnvironBuilder` subclass at some point, rather than a factory wrapper.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @davidism in https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3181#issuecomment-493489553_",
