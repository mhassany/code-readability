It allows people to configure their applications with environment variables in JSON syntax, without any config file.\n\nStoring config in environment variables is a recommended practice of [12-Factor App](http://12factor.net/config). It is supported by many development and deployment utilities, including systemd(`EnvironmentFile` field in service file), [honcho](https://github.com/nickstenning/honcho), [autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) and more.\n\nPlease review it.

            "body": "While I understand that this can be useful to some projects, I'm not convinced it should be included with Flask.\n\nThe function name is confusing.  We already have `from_envvar`, which reads a Python file pointed to by an environment variable.  `from_envjson` first suggests that this is one var that will point at a JSON file, or perhaps one very long env var that contains the full JSON document.  Why is a lot of env vars a better use case than either of these other possibilities?\n\nBefore this and the `from_json` methods was added, there was only _one_ official way (PEP 20!) to handle configuration: Python, with all it's power.  Either an object, an import, or a file from the root, the instance folder, or an env var, but all Python.  The more methods we add beyond that, the less clear it is to new developers what to choose.  It should be left to the developer to read in their config if they have a reason to use another source.\n\nThis and `from_json` would fit better in the Snippets area of the docs.\n\nPing @DasIch, I'd like to hear your rationale for the `from_json` and `from_mapping` methods, I couldn't find an issue discussing them.\n"
