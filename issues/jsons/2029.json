I think this would help others who come across the problem.\n\nThe general workaround is indeed to ignore the errors. I think GitHub itself does this so that when you push changes to GitHub an fsck isn't done on objects so they push cleanly. Some git hosting software doesn't do this though, I hit the issue when upload flask to GitLab (self-hosted) and found it rejected pushing the whole repository. This is a rare use case however.\n\nThe standard option I found when researching was to do a rebuild via git fast-export/fast-import, but as you say this option is not acceptable as all the hashes change and tree references are lost. \n\nThere is a discussion about this happening to another repo here: https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/issues/231 \n\nI'm afraid I'm out of my depth to help much more than this, unless the project has some git experts I would suggest documenting the corrupted objects somewhere in the repo docs and closing this issue. \n"
