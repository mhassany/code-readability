    "body": "Is there a way to add a global catch-all error handler in which I can change the response to a generic JSON response?\n\nI can't use the `got_request_exception` signal, as it is not allowed to modify the response (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/signals/).\n\n> In contrast all signal handlers are executed in undefined order and do not modify any data.\n\nI would prefer to not wrap the `app.handle_exception` function as that feels like internal API. I guess I'm after something like:\n\n``` python\n@app.errorhandler()\ndef handle_global_error(e):\n  return \"Global error\"\n```\n\nNote the `errorhandler` does not take any parameters, meaning it would catch all exceptions/status codes which does not have a specific error handler attached to them. I know I can use `errorhandler(500)` to catch exceptions, but if I do `abort(409)` for example, it will still return a HTML response.\n",
