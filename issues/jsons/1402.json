    "body": "Multiple issues including #248 call for `jsonify` to handle lists. As discussed there, allowing toplevel arrays should pose no security problem nowadays. A config parameter is added to enable this functionality, and an array is returned only when a conversion to an object is not possible to maintain backwards compatibility.\n\nIn short, when `JSONIFY_ALLOW_TOPLEVEL_ARRAY` is set, `jsonify(1, 2, 3)`, `jsonify(question='Ultimate', answer=42)`, and `jsonify({'question': 'Ultimate', 'answer': 42})` all work as expected.  Note that unlike dicts, `jsonify([1, 2, 3])` will result in nested lists, so always use `jsonify(*l)` for a list variable `l`.\n"
