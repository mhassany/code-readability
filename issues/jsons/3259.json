This is not the place to report issues with Flask extensions such as Flask-MongoAlchemy, such issues should be reported in the issue trackers for those other projects (in this case, https://github.com/cobrateam/flask-mongoalchemy/issues). For an issue report like this, you should also give the version of the extension that you observed the problem in, ideally with a link to the offending line(s) of code, but only after confirming that the issue has not already been fixed in a more recent version of the code."
