            "body": "@wgwz , I tried to write some test case  about  `Flask.test_client()`  to check the view whether is normal , so I want to get more information  about `Flask.test_client()`,  for example, post files or json, custom headers, allow_redirect, response and so on. \r\nHowever, I looked through the document, can't find any snippets about this. I found that `Flask.test_client()` usually call `FlaskClient.open` and I confused the parameters information about `FlaskClient.open` such as `as_tuple` and other kwargs. Maybe, we can specify kwargs what we can pass to.\r\n\r\nThere are my suggestions:\r\n1. Give some more detail  information about `FlaskClient.open` parameters, we can learn from [requests \r\n doc](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/), \r\n2. Add some common test case like post files or json, custom request headers, and other function\r\n3. Maybe, give information about `FlaskClient.open` response?\r\n\r\n\\#  I'm so sorry "
