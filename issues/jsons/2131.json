For the sake of less confusion, for those working through this example, having src might be helpful. Not everyone will want to work along with the docs. If there are parts of the docs that are not clear, we should fix that as well. (They seemed clear to me).\r\n\r\nThiefmaster's response:\r\n\r\n> The weird commits in this PR aside (rebase to upstream/master and force-push to fix), I'm not sure how useful this is to have in the repo... Especially since having a \"large\" app without an app factory is somewhat questionable...\r\n\r\nMy response:\r\n\r\n> @ThiefMaster Sorry about that. I didn't choose correct base. I was thinking that in order to debug issues that people are having with code examples in the docs, it would be useful to have those examples on-hand.\r\n> \r\n> I agree. But maybe until we can put something better together for #2027, this addition could just be temporary and we could deprecate this \"larger applications\" example at later time.",

Maybe at that point this whole larger app portion of the docs can be written with respect to flaskr. \r\n\r\n> Fair enough though this doesn't test anything because pytest doesn't import the package. We should add a test stub as well that just imports and install the package in tox.ini.\r\n\r\n@untitaker assuming you want to go forward with this, would *tox.ini* change as below? and what else needs to change/be added? I don't follow what you are saying.
