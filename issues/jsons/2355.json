The version scheme we use is [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) compliant and has not changed format as far as I can remember.\r\n\r\nIt looks like while the onionshare AUR allows `python-flask-git` as an alternative to `python-flask`, it doesn't actually expect its version scheme.
