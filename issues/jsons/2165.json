    "body": "I am having issues when retrieving static components on subfolders in my project. Let me explain\r\n\r\nMy structure is as follows:\r\n\r\nMain.py\r\n--- App1.py\r\n--- App2.py\r\n\r\nIt is, i have a main page that has links that refers to App1.py or App2.py, which are also flask programs\r\n\r\nWhen i access App1.py, i dont have static content displayed. The html of the page is correctly displayed (under templates/App1/app1.html), but, looks like it is unable to find the static component referred in that page (i am referring from the html to static component under static/app1/css/app1.css). I have a 404 response\r\n\r\nIs that something that is not supported by flask?\r\n\r\nThanks",
