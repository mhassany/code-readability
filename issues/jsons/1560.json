            "body": "@untitaker Thanks for taking a look at this and sorry for the delay in responding! I've been swamped with urgent work, but I'd still love to contribute a fix for this issue, and make any required changes to get it landed, ideally before I forget what the problem is again and have to start over.\r\n\r\n> I think a better fix would be if we delay registration of the static route until the first request.\r\n\r\nThe user still needs a way to pass a host for the static route though, right? In that case, what is the advantage of delaying registration of the static route until the first request, when we can do it correctly at app instantiation time provided a `static_host` param?\r\n\r\nEven still, I tried delaying registration of the static route until the first request anyway just to see if it would work, but it didn't. Ultimately there is a chicken-and-egg problem. By the time we get the first request and go to add the static route, if the first request was for the static endpoint, we will already get an incorrect 404 for it before we've had a chance to add the static route.\r\n\r\nI worked up a new PR for this in #2211 which applies cleanly against latest master. In that version, rather than add the two new constructor parameters `host_matching` and `static_host`, where `host_matching` *should* be True if `static_host` is passed, I made it so that there's only the single new `static_host` parameter, which if passed causes `host_matching` to be set to True implicitly. Maybe that's preferable."
