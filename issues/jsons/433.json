    "body": "I needed this method to adjust the cache control headers for .js files that one of my applications was statically serving.  The default expiration is buried in an argument to `send_file` and is set to 12 hours.  There was no good way to adjust this value previously.  So I added a new method to `_PackageBoundObject` named `get_static_file_options` that returns a dict (empty by default) of keywords to pass into `send_file`.  This can be overridden in the `flask.Flask` derivative to adjust values based on the debug flag or filename.\n",
