    "body": "Small doc change because it is not documented anywhere else and may be confusing. \r\n\r\nIf a user is making use of the `@errorhandler(405)` decorator, and they wish to include an Allow header (as per HTTP spec), they may be confused to find that url_rule is None (when they were attempting to get the allowed methods). While an experienced Flask user knows why this won't work, it may be unclear to a new user who is attempting to conform to HTTP. \r\n\r\nThis doc change aims to clarify that: because the request was never successfully matched, it was never bound to a URL rule.  In order to access the valid methods, they must examine `routing_exception` instead.\r\n\r\nDoc change only, no uncommented code is affected. \r\n",

Thank you for taking the time to share the fruits of your troubleshooting. \r\n\r\nAs an aside coincidentally, I just read this article yesterday: [Matplotlib Lead Developer Explains Why He Can\u2019t Fix the Docs\u2014But You Can](https://www.numfocus.org/blog/matplotlib-lead-developer-explains-why-he-cant-fix-the-docs-but-you-can/) wherein the lead dev provides a call to action to do just this.\r\n\r\n>\"What I\u2019ve started trying to push as the threshold on docs is, \u201cDid it make it worse?\u201d If it didn\u2019t make it worse, merge it. Frequently, it takes more time to leave a GitHub comment than to fix it.\"\r\n\r\nI wonder if there are some tests we can put around this behavior more for reference and confirmation that it **should** work this way and as a minor benefit - catch it in the unlikely event that the behavior changes in the future. Definitely should not block merging this in."
