    "body": "`flask.json_available` was removed because it was marked deprecated in the code and doesn't do anything. `flask.json` is always available, and libaries that weren't sure about that should have used `try/except ImportError` while it was relevant. However, since a few dormant but popular extensions use it, it's added back in for now.\r\n\r\nAnything doing `if json_available` or `if json_available == True`, such as Flask-Testing and Flask-DebugToolbar, will show a `DeprecationWarning`. `is` can't be overridden, so that won't show a warning, but I don't think things that were using this flag did that.\r\n\r\nI've marked it for removal in 2.0.0, which will be a pretty big change anyway. Please reach out to extensions you use if you see this warning and offer to help maintain it if it's an extension you want to continue using as Flask moves forward.\r\n\r\ncloses #3288 ",
