1. calculate raw metrics for files
    - cc
    - hal
    - mi
    - pylint
    - loc,comment,...

2. get top few changed files
    - by commit count
    - by line changes count

3. cross check the result of step1, and 2
   and narrow down the list of files to few (20)
    - make sure those files still exists in the repo

4. get number of contributors for each of those files 
   people who contributed in last 2 year (active contributors)

5. check the issues to see # of readability related issues (comments)
   also bugs, and complexity (indirect relation)
    - find the related file
    - cross check it with previous file list

6. now we have a list of files that need to be check for readability
